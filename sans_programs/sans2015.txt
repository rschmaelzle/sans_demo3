Keynote Address
The biology of strategic social behavior
5:00 – 6:00 PM
Speaker: Michael Platt

ABSTRACT
Most primates seem specialized for social life, yet how biology shapes complex
social behaviors remains poorly understood. To address this gap, we study the
biology and behavior of rhesus macaques in both the laboratory and the field.
Recent work in the lab shows that monkeys favor giving rewards to another
monkey, particularly if he is more familiar or subordinate, rather than give the
rewards to no one. Oxytocin—a hormone implicated in social bonding—makes
monkeys more giving. Finally, giving behavior selectively activates cells in medial
frontal cortex, an area previously implicated in empathy in humans. In a separate
study, we found inactivating this area impairs social learning. By contrast, when
monkeys play a competitive game against each other, they rapidly develop
unpredictable behaviors that serve to hide their intentions. Planning deceptive
feints activates a population of neurons in the lateral frontal cortex, an area linked
to deceptive planning in humans; inactivating these cells impairs deceptive
planning. In the field, we find that intraspecific variation in social behavior and
cognition has fitness consequences and emerges, in part, from genes that
regulate neuromodulatory function. Together, our findings suggest deep
homologies in the biological origins of complex social function in primates.

ABSTRACTS
A HUMAN UNIQUE MIND-MELD?: FROM BEHAVIOR-CONTAGION TO MINDCONTAGION Laurie Santos, Yale University – What allows for our human unique
ability to jump into the minds of others? Synthesizing recent work in primate social
cognition, I'll argue that humans possess a species-unique capacity to mindmeld— an automatic mental state contagion that stems from our unique ability to
represent the mental states of others. I'll first review work on emotional and
behavioral contagion in non-human primates, suggesting that primates share our
human capacity to automatically jump into other individuals' behavioral states. I'll
then present recent work from primate theory of mind and social problem-solving
to argue that other primates may lack the capacity to automatically represent
others' mental states in the way humans do. However, I'll also argue that our
human capacity to represent others' mental states comes with a representational
cost— the act of representing others' beliefs, intentions, and preferences
sometimes causes us to have less access to our own. I'll then discuss what this new
empirical predictions this hypothesis provides for the field of social neuroscience.

EMPATHIC HELPING IN RATS AND ITS MODULATION BY SOCIAL PARAMETERS Inbal
Bartal, University of California, Berkeley – Empathy, the recognition and sharing of
affective states between individuals, is an adaptive response with ancient
evolutionary roots. It has been clearly established that rodents show emotional
contagion for the distress of conspecifics. The Empathic Helping paradigm we
established shows that rats will intentionally release a cagemate trapped in a
restrainer. When a second restrainer containing a highly palatable food
(chocolate chips) was present, rats opened both restrainers and typically shared
the chocolate. Yet, helping others is costly and resource depleting, and should
thus be discriminately extended. In humans, the expression of empathically
motivated pro-social behavior is dependent on social context, where people are
more motivated to help in-group members than out-group members.
Correspondingly, others have found that emotional contagion is modulated by
familiarity in rodents. Studies using the helping behavior test demonstrate that prosocial motivation in rats is dependent on emotional contagion as well as the social
context.!

OBSERVING OTHERS’ FACE-TO-FACE CONFRONTATIONS SHAPES SOCIAL RANK
LEARNING AND THREAT RESPONSES Jan Haaker, Karolinska Institute – Social groups
in both humans and other animals are organized along dominance hierarchies
that regulate the access to valuable resources. The rank order in a hierarchy is
often established through aggressive displays between conspecifics, and such
displays might be visible to others in the group, providing a means to learn about
the rank of others. We examined how observing dyadic confrontations between
other individuals shaped the learning of social rank, and how these experiences
affected subsequent conditioned fear learning about the observed individuals. In
two behavioral and one fMRI experiment, we show that observing dyadic
confrontations of others is sufficient for learning their positions in the social
hierarchy. We found that observing the confrontations of others elicited defensive
responses (potentiation of the eye-blink startle reflex) and amygdala reactivity.
Both of these responses decreased as individual learning about the social
hierarchy increased. The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and the amygdala
coded for the social rank during confrontation. Moreover, we observed that
pairing an individual with high, as compared to low, social rank with an aversive
outcome (electric shock) during fear conditioning, resulted in enhanced
psychophysiological, and sustained amygdala, responses. Our results demonstrate
that learning about social rank can emerge through observing others’
confrontations, which enhances threat responses towards high dominant
individuals. These findings enhance our understanding of the neurobiology
underlying social dominance, which serves a key role in both normal social
functioning and the development of neuropsychiatric conditions.

!
JUDGING, FEELING, THINKING: WHAT MAKES US SPECIAL? Joshua Greene, Harvard
University –!Human brains closely resemble those of other primates, yet we do
many nifty things that they do not. It’s often said that we humans are distinguished
by our “humanity”, by our moral sensibilities. But research on moral cognition says
that human morality is not the product of a distinctive moral faculty. Instead,
moral judgment and behavior depend on the coordinated interaction of multiple
neural systems, none of which appears to be specifically dedicated to moral
cognition and all (or nearly all?) of which appear to be shared with other animals.
What, then, makes us special? I propose that an essential ingredient—if not the
essential ingredient—is our ability to rapidly and flexibly combine multi-modal
concepts to form complex thoughts. I will discuss some new research on this
remarkable human ability and consider its relation to other candidate answers to
the “What makes us special?” question: language, “prospection”, explicit
reasoning, and the commitment to abstract ideals.

Emotion Regulation: Current Status and Future Prospects
Friday, April 24, 2015
10:45 – 12:00 PM
Speaker: James Gross

ABSTRACT
The past decade has seen an extraordinary increase in research on emotion
regulation. Work from dozens of laboratories around the world has converged to

9

!
establish that emotion regulation plays a crucial role in determining a wide range
of affective, cognitive, and social outcomes. In this talk, I will do three things. In the
first part of the talk, I will define emotion and emotion regulation, and describe a
framework for understanding the role of emotion regulation in healthy adaptation.
In the second part of the talk, I will review key research findings which suggest that
specific forms of emotion regulation have different consequences for affective,
cognitive, and social functioning. In the third part of the talk, I will discuss key
questions that must be addressed by this field.

ABSTRACTS
SAVORING THE PAST: THE VALUE OF RECALLING POSITIVE MEMORIES Mauricio
Delgado, Rutgers University – Maintaining positive feelings is associated with an
increased ability for emotion regulation, which may benefit one’s ability to cope
with stressors in daily life. One way to elicit positive emotions is to reminisce about
past positive life events. Autobiographical memories are vivid representations of
the past that can serve various functions, such as bolstering self-identity. Such
memories can also trigger the re-experience of emotions tied to the original event,
eliciting positive feelings and enhancing an individual’s well-being. In this talk, I will

10

!
discuss behavioral and neuroimaging data suggesting that the recall of positive
memories is intrinsically valuable to an individual. Specifically, recalling the
positive past can recruit neural circuits involved in reward processing, and can
influence emotion and decision-making. The act of recalling positive memories
can also help dampen the physiological effects of acute stress. Taken together,
these results highlight how reminiscing about the positive past serves an important
function in the maintenance of positive feelings and the promotion of successful
adaptation to stress.

!

POSITIVE REINFORCEMENT ENHANCES ENCODING OF UPCOMING INFORMATION
Daniel Dillon, McLean Hospital, Harvard Medical School – Each day we form many
short-term memories, most of which rapidly decay. However, some episodes stay
with us for years, even decades. What triggers memory retention? We
hypothesized that positive reinforcement is critical: by activating brain reward
networks that communicate with medial temporal lobe memory regions, positive
reinforcement may promote consolidation. To test this idea, in Experiment 1 38
adults viewed 240 natural and man-made images and decided to keep or reject
each one. Decisions were reinforced by delivery of “rewards” (monetary
feedback) or “zeros” (no monetary feedback), and the reinforcement rate for
stimulus/response pairings varied throughout the task. Participants returned a day
later for a surprise recognition memory test. Consistent with the hypothesis,
memory was better for images that followed rewards versus zeros (Z = 4.40, p <
0.001). In Experiment 2, 22 adults completed the same task during functional
magnetic resonance imaging. Memory accuracy was again higher for images
preceded by rewards versus zeros (Z = 4.04, p < 0.001). A whole-brain “rewardzero” contrast revealed activation of bilateral hippocampus (left, Z = 4.58; right, Z =
5.17) and ventromedial prefrontal cortex (Z = 4.94), indicating coactivation of
regions implicated in episodic encoding and reward valuation (p < 0.05, FWEcorrected). Because the memory tests were unexpected, these results cannot be
attributed to strategic effects at encoding. Thus, positive reinforcement facilitates
incidental encoding of upcoming information, leading to better retention. This
mechanism may help explain the coincidence of anhedonia and memory deficits
in certain psychiatric conditions, such as depression.

!
HYPERALTRUISM AND ITS NEUROMODULATION BY SEROTONIN AND DOPAMINE Molly
Crockett, Oxford University – How we evaluate the suffering of others is a central
concern in moral decision-making, but its neural basis is not well understood. Here,
we investigate how people evaluate others’ pain relative to their own pain, and
how serotonin and dopamine shape this evaluation process. To investigate these
questions, we observed people trading off profits for themselves against pain for
themselves or an anonymous other person, and used computational models to
quantify how they valued others’ pain relative to their own pain. In two behavioral
studies, we show that most people are 'hyperaltruistic', sacrificing more money to
prevent others’ pain than their own pain. In two subsequent pharmacological
studies, we examined the effects of the serotonin reuptake inhibitor citalopram
and the dopamine precursor levodopa on the valuation of pain for self and
others. Citalopram and levodopa had distinct and opposing effects on moral
decision-making. Our findings have implications for understanding antisocial
behavior in psychiatric disorders associated with abnormal serotonergic and
dopaminergic function.

!
GOOD NEWS AND BAD NEWS: HOW HUMANS INCORPORATE INFORMATION Tali
Sharot, University College London – We are constantly flooded with information
(e.g., via the Web, advertising, colleagues, and friends) that helps us form
predictions about the future and make decisions. Classic theories in psychology,
economics and machine learning all implicitly assume that beliefs are adjusted in
a similar manner in response to desirable and undesirable information. In this talk I

11

!
will provide evidence challenging these assumptions. I will show that while people
incorporate good news into their existing beliefs in a normative manner, they
display an aversion to incorporating bad news, discounting the strength of the
information leading to noisy posterior beliefs. This asymmetry in how we
incorporate information can have important societal implications including the
generation of financial market bubbles and ill preparedness in the face of natural
disasters. However, we find that the asymmetry is not set in stone, but rather
fluctuates in response to threats in the environment, in a way that may be
adaptive. Using a combination of fMRI, TMS and DTI we characterise the neural
system supporting this asymmetry and show that changes in this circuit are related
to individual differences in behaviour and mental health, with more balanced
coding of information observed in depression and middle age.

On the Neural Circuits for Face Recognition: a Vision Science
Perspective on the Social Brain

ABSTRACT
Faces provide powerful inroads into the social brain: they evoke emotions,
activate memories, draw and direct attention, and elicit communicative
responses. Thus faces have provided the social neurosciences with powerful tools
to map the neural circuits and unravel the neural mechanisms of the social brain.
Faces, as it turns out, similarly provide the visual neurosciences with a unique
opportunity to decipher the neural mechanisms of object recognition. This is for
two reasons. Faces are a well-defined stimulus class, and primates have evolved a
beautiful dedicated face-processing system that is particularly amenable to
neuroscientific analysis. The temporal and frontal lobes of macaque monkeys
contain neural machinery to support face recognition, consisting of a fixed
number of discrete patches of face-selective cortex. The four main organizing

12

!
features of this system, concentration of cells encoding the same complex object
category into modules, functional specializations of modules, spatial separation of
modules, and integration of modules into a network, make it possible to break
down the process of face recognition into its components. In my talk I will describe
this network and a close companion we recently discovered, both from a vision
and a social cognition perspective. I will describe how the system is embedded
into the rest of the brain in ways that are suggestive for how the network may
support the powerful emotive and cognitive functions faces elicit. I will indicate
how these investigations of the macaque social brain may aid our understanding
of human social cognition.

Face to face, Brain to brain: Exploring the mechanisms of dyadic
social interactions

ABSTRACT
Neuroimaging studies of language have typically focused on either production or
comprehension of single speech utterances such as syllables, words, or sentences.
In this talk I will introduce novel methodological and analytical tools we
developed for characterizing the neural responses during production and
comprehension of complex real-life speech. First, using a time-warp based intrasubject correlation method, we identified all areas that are reliably activated in
the brains of speakers telling a fifteen minute long narrative. Next, we identified
areas that are reliably activated in the brains of listeners as they comprehended
that same narrative. This allowed us to identify networks of brain regions specific to
production and comprehension, as well as those that are shared between the two
processes. The results indicate that production of a real-life narrative is not
localized to the left hemisphere but recruits an extensive bilateral network, which
overlaps extensively with the comprehension system. Moreover, by directly
comparing the neural activity timecourses during production and comprehension
of the same narrative, we were able to identify not only the spatial overlap of
activity but also areas in which the neural activity is correlated (coupled) across
the speaker’s and listener’s brains during production and comprehension of the
same narrative. We demonstrate widespread bilateral coupling between
production- and comprehension-related processing within both linguistic and nonlinguistic areas, exposing the extent of shared processes across the two systems.
The ability to communicate thoughts to other brains is a hallmark feature of
human cognition. The robust production-comprehension coupling observed here
underlines the importance of studying comprehension and production within a
unified framework. Just as one cannot study the processes by which information is
transmitted at the synaptic level by focusing solely on the pre-synaptic or postsynaptic compartments, one cannot fully characterize the communication system
by focusing on the processes within the border of a single isolated brain.

ABSTRACTS
THE FACE, A TRANSMITTER OF DYNAMIC SOCIAL SIGNALS Philippe Schyns, University
of Glasgow – One of the most powerful tools in social communication is the face,
from which observers can quickly and easily extract rich information for various
social judgments Ð e.g., identity, gender/sex, age, race/ethnicity, sexual
orientation, physical health, attractiveness, emotional state, personality traits,
states of pain or physical pleasure, deception and even social status. Yet, since
the face comprises a high dimensional information space, identifying precisely
which information subtends the dynamic perception of social categories remains
challenging. Understanding this relationship - i.e., between information transmitted
in the external environment and its interpretation by an observer - is a central goal
of psychophysics. Here, I will demonstrate a key selection of data-driven methods each based on the psychophysical method of reverse correlation - which aims to
isolate, in the high dimensional information space of the face, the precise
information that elicits the perception of a given social category.

ENHANCEMENT OF FACIAL EXPRESSION RECOGNITION BY ANODAL TRANSCRANIAL
DIRECT CURRENT STIMULATION Megan Willis, Australian Catholic University – The
ability to recognise facial expressions is fundamental to effective social
communication and deficits in this capacity can have devastating social
consequences. The orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) is one neural structure that has
been implicated in the capacity to accurately recognise facial expressions. The
current study used a mild brain stimulation technique called transcranial direct
current stimulation (tDCS) to excite the neural activity of the right OFC in healthy
adults. It was anticipated that anodal tDCS administered to the right OFC would
enhance facial expression recognition when compared to the sham condition.
Across two counterbalanced sessions of tDCS (i.e., anodal and sham), 20
undergraduate participants (16 female) completed a forced choice facial
expression labelling task comprising angry, disgusted, fearful, happy, sad and
neutral expressions. Responses were scored for accuracy, median reaction time,
and overall efficiency (i.e., combined accuracy and reaction time). The results
indicated that anodal tDCS to the right OFC enhanced facial expression
recognition, as reflected in greater efficiency and speed of recognition across all
emotions, compared to participants’ performance in the sham condition. This

14

!
finding is the first to demonstrate that anodal tDCS to the right OFC can boost
facial expression recognition. These findings provide a solid foundation for further
research to examine the potential efficacy of this technique as a means to treat
facial expression recognition deficits, particularly in those with OFC damage or
dysfunction.

!
NEUROPHYSIOLOGICAL RESPONSES TO VOCAL EMOTION CUES IN AND OUT OF
SPEECH Marc Pell, McGill University – In this study we used ERPs to compare the
time course for processing vocal emotions expressed through non-linguistic
vocalizations and in speech prosody, to test whether emotional vocalizations are
treated preferentially by the neurocognitive system. Young adults passively
listened to angry, sad, or happy pseudo-utterances and corresponding
vocalizations (i.e., grunts, sobs, laughter) while focusing on a subsequent visual
target (a face). ERPs time-locked to voice onset looked at the effects of vocal
expression type and emotion type on ERP components related to acoustic
structure building (N100), emotional salience detection (P200), and cognitive
elaboration of vocal emotional meanings (Late Positive Component, LPC). Results
suggest that non-linguistic vocalizations are preferentially processed over speechembedded emotions at early processing stages (N1-P2 complex), affecting both
the amplitude and latency of these components. At the stage where the
motivational significance of vocal stimuli is registered (P200), vocalizations elicited
stronger, earlier, and more differentiated responses than speech; vocalizations
(especially anger) also evoked a stronger late positivity (LPC) effect than
emotional prosody in the 450-700ms time window. Secondary analyses suggested
that individuals with high trait anxiety exhibited early, heightened sensitivity to
vocal emotion cues (particularly vocalizations) as well as later differences in how
attention may have been deployed to emotional speech. Our findings show that
while neuronal responses to emotional speech and vocalizations follow a similar
electrophysiological pattern, as evolutionarily primitive signals of human emotion
in the auditory modality, vocalizations are accorded precedence over speech.

!
NEURAL REPRESENTATIONS OF EXTERNAL EVENTS AND THEIR INTERNAL AFFECT Adam
Anderson, Cornell University – Over a century ago W. Wundt proposed the
construct of affect—the way sensory events “affect” us—as a unique dimension of
perceptual experience. It remains unclear how the brain represents external
objective sensory events alongside our internal subjective impressions of them. We
employed representational mapping of multivoxel activity patterns evoked by
complex scenes and basic tastes and uncovered neural codes supporting a
continuous axis of pleasant-to-unpleasant valence. Valence information was
encoded both within modality specific primary and secondary gustatory and
visual cortices. This visual valence code was distinct from low-level physical and
high-level object property representations. The gustatory valence code was
largely distinct from representations of basic taste qualities. In contrast to the
ventral temporal and anterior insular cortices that supported valence codes
specific to vision and taste, the medial and lateral orbitofrontal cortices
maintained a valence code independent of sensory origin. Only the OFC code
could classify experienced affect across participants. These results demonstrate
the entire valence spectrum is represented as a collective pattern of regional
neural activity as sensory-specific and abstract codes. While the former may
provide support for Wundt’s thesis of affect as a primary perceptual dimension,
the latter affords a reference frame in which the subjective quality of affect can
be objectively quantified across stimuli, modalities, and people.

ABSTRACTS
HOW EXPECTATIONS SHAPE AVERSIVE LEARNING Lauren Atlas, National Center for
Complementary and Integrative Health, NIH – Decades of work in human
neuroscience indicate that cognitive factors such as verbal instructions can shape
emotion, affect, and decisions. Recent work in human neuroscience suggests that
instructions also shape dynamic value-based learning in both appetitive and
aversive domains. We know less about whether our own cognitive beliefs also
shape how we learn about our environment. We tested whether explicit, cognitive
factors that are self-generated, rather than external, also shape aversive learning.
We examined whether the strength, speed, and mechanisms of aversive learning
are modulated when individuals explicitly report expectations during aversive
learning, relative to participants who do not make any judgments. We performed
two experiments: A behavioral study (Study 1; N = 80) and an fMRI study (Study 2;
N = 40). In both studies, participants were randomly assigned to either an
Expectancy Rating Group or a Passive Group. Both groups performed a Pavlovian
fear conditioning task with a single reversal. The Expectancy Rating Group
recorded shock expectancy on a continuous visual analogue scale on every trial,
whereas the Passive Group viewed stimuli and received shocks without making
any responses. We found that making expectancy ratings actually slowed
learning, as measured by smaller differential skin conductance responses following
the reversal, as well as significantly lower learning rates across the entire task. FMRI
analyses revealed that the Passive Group showed larger differential responses
across the entire task, and also showed larger differential responses post-reversal in
bilateral ventral striatum and left amygdala. These results indicate that attending
to expectations actually slows simple associative learning. Expectancies are likely

16

!
to be sensitive to higher order rules rather than simple associations, which reduces
purely feedback-driven associative learning.
THE NEXUS MODEL OF THE TPJ AND CO-OPTED SOCIAL FUNCTION
R. McKell Carter, University of Colorado – We have identified the temporal parietal
junction (TPJ) as a region of the brain that uniquely predicts social decisions. We
describe here the nexus model for TPJ function, in which the neural organizing
principles of hierarchy and proximity are used to reconcile the role of TPJ in social
cognition with its hypothesized role in attention and memory. The nexus model
proposes that novel functions (e.g., mentalizing) arise in the brain where previously
unassociated computational streams are brought into close proximity. I will discuss
the implications of the nexus model in both the contexts of healthy social
processing and the autism spectrum disorders, in which social processing could be
co-opted in favor of objects of circumscribed interest.

REDUCED SELF-REFERENTIAL NEURAL RESPONSE DURING INTERGROUP COMPETITION
PREDICTS COMPETITOR HARM Mina Cikara, Harvard University -- Why do
interactions become more hostile when social relations shift from “me versus you”
to “us versus them”? We tested whether acting with a group reduces spontaneous
self-referential processing in the moral domain and facilitates competitor harm. In
an fMRI experiment: participants (n=21) performed a competitive task once alone
and once with a group; we indexed spontaneous self-referential processing during
competition using activation in an independently localized region of the medial
prefrontal cortex (mPFC/pgACC) associated with self-reference; and we assessed
participants' willingness to harm competitors versus teammates. Participants
performed a go/no-go task—once with their teammates (ostensibly one room
over) and once alone. The cover story for the experiment was related to social
communication. Half of the items were in first-person and true of participants
(assessed via pre-test); half were written in third-person and untrue. Go items were
related to communication, e.g., “She has a twitter account.” No-go items were
related to good and bad moral behavior, e.g., “I have stolen food from a shared
refrigerator” (“distractors” were never labeled as moral). In the group (but not the
alone) condition, a significant correlation was observed: robust mPFC response to
first-person (vs. third-person) moral items was associated with benign treatment of
competitors, whereas reduced (or reversed) mPFC response to these items was
associated with selecting less flattering photos of competitors relative to
teammates. In other words, attenuated mPFC response to self-relevant moral
information during intergroup competition, but not during individual competition,
was associated with later willingness to harm a competitor.

THE DEVELOPMENTAL EMERGENCE OF GOAL-DIRECTED BEHAVIOR Catherine
Hartley, Weill Cornell Medical College -- Psychological theories and experimental
data distinguish “goal-directed” behaviors, performed to obtain specific desired
future outcomes, from “habits”, actions rendered stimulus-bound and automatic
through previous reinforcement. Goal-directed behavior is proposed to rely upon
a “model-based” learning process, which recruits a cognitive model of potential
actions and outcomes to flexibly pursue a goal. In contrast, habits are thought to
stem from a more efficient “model-free” learning process that enables previously
rewarded behaviors to be repeated without forethought or attention. Modelbased learning is proposed to recruit prefrontal-subcortical circuitry, which
undergoes substantial structural and functional change as individuals mature from
childhood into adulthood. This suggests that the reliance on goal-directed versus
habitual action might also change markedly with age. In this study, we examined
the developmental trajectories of these two forms of action selection. Children,
adolescents, and adults performed a two-stage reinforcement-learning task
through which we can assess whether participants rely upon a cognitive model of
the task to make choices, or whether they simply repeat previously rewarded
actions. Our data suggest that whereas model-free learning is recruited from

17

!
childhood onwards, model-based influences on choice are not evident until
adolescence, and continue to strengthen into adulthood. This protracted
maturation of goal-directed behavior may contribute to the shortsighted decisionmaking in affective contexts that is commonly observed during adolescence.

NEURAL BASIS OF VALUATION AND DECISION-MAKING FOR SELF AND OTHERS
Hackjin Kim, Korea University -- Why and how do we make decisions for others?
What distinguishes prosocial decision from selfish one? The ability to accurately
estimate other people’s preferences and make prosocial choices for others, albeit
not immediately related to one’s own profit, can be critical for establishing and
maintaining successful social life in human society. Recent studies from my lab
demonstrated that the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (DMPFC), possibly through its
communication with the temporo-parietal junction (TPJ), can be preferentially
engaged in computing values of risky decisions for others, and that its activity
predicted accuracy in the estimation of other people’s preferences on various
items based on brief exposures to their appearances. Contrary to a large body of
literatures supporting the role of DMPFC in mentalization, however, we suggest
that DMPFC activity is not necessarily associated with altruistic/prosocial decisions.
In support of this argument, we recently observed that, when people learn to
maximize benefits of themselves or others, activity in the ventromedial prefrontal
cortex (VMPFC) encoded more self- than other-regarding values, while the
opposite was true for DMPFC. Interestingly, such a spatially segregated functional
dissociation within the medial prefrontal cortex was more prominent among selfish
than prosocial participants. Finally, one of the latest studies from my lab showed
that others’ observation facilitated ethical consumer decisions via increase in the
intuitive valuation system involving the ventral cortico-thalamo-striatal loop, which
was then accompanied by decreased DMPFC activity. In summary, these findings
provide further supports to the dual-process model of prosocial decision. More
specifically, the ventral cortico-thalamo-striatal loop, serving as an intuitive
valuation system primarily for self-regarding decisions, can be also recruited to
elicit socially desirable other-regarding decisions among prosocial individuals
particularly under social pressure. On the contrary, the dorsal counterpart working
in conjunction with TPJ may override/suppress the intuitive valuation process to
promote a more deliberative analysis of goal-relevant information, leading to a
more strategic other-regarding choice.

THE NEURAL UNDERPINNINGS OF IMPLICIT PREJUDICE INTERVENTION Jennifer
Kubota, University of Chicago -- Implicit racial prejudice is ubiquitous in the United
States and predictive of many discriminatory behaviors, but ultimately malleable.
Scholars are uncovering the neural mechanisms that underlie implicit prejudice
intervention. In this talk, I will present functional neuroimaging and brain lesion
research, exploring the neural regions that support successful implicit prejudice
reduction. Data presented will focus on a network of regions involved in emotion
and emotion regulation (including the amygdala, DLPFC, and ACC) to highlight
how exposure to counterstereotypes decreases implicit bias by altering evaluative
and regulatory processing.

!
THE BRAIN BASIS OF POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE AFFECT: EVIDENCE FROM A METAANALYSIS OF THE HUMAN NEUROIMAGING LITERATURE Kristen Lindquist, University of
North Carolina -- The ability to experience pleasant or unpleasant feelings, or to
represent objects as “positive” or “negative” is known as representing hedonic
“valence.” Although scientists overwhelmingly agree that valence is a basic
psychological phenomenon, debate continues about how to best conceptualize
it scientifically. We used a meta-analysis of 397 functional magnetic resonance
imaging (fMRI) and positron emission tomography (PET) studies (containing 914
experimental contrasts and 6827 participants) to test three competing hypotheses
about the brain basis of valence: the bipolarity hypothesis that positive and

18

!
negative affect are supported by a brain system that monotonically increases
and/or decreases along the valence dimension, the bivalent hypothesis that
positive and negative affect are supported by independent brain systems, and
the affective workspace hypothesis that positive and negative affect are
supported by a flexible set of valence general regions. We found little evidence
for the bipolar or bivalent hypotheses. Findings instead supported the hypothesis
that, at the level of brain activity measurable by fMRI, valence is flexibly
implemented across instances by a set of valence general limbic and paralimbic
brain regions.
SOCIAL INFLUENCES ON FEAR Dean Mobbs, Columbia University -- My talk will focus
on the neural basis of fear and anxiety and how the social environment influences
these emotions. I will present data showing that our perceptions of fear alter when
we are alone vs in a group and that these differences also rely on how we rate our
group members abilities to protect us. These studies support the theory that there
are two key survival advantages of group living - protection and stress reduction.

ACETAMINOPHEN BLUNTS INTERGROUP BIASES IN MENTAL REPRESENTATIONS OF
FACES Kyle Ratner, University of California, Santa Barbara -- Acetaminophen, the
active drug in Tylenol, is generally used to relieve pain. However, a growing body
of research suggests that the drug has broader psychological effects (Dewall et
al., 2010; Randles et al., 2013). Our lab has recently shown that acetaminophen
blunts positive and negative reactivity to emotional images (Durso, Luttrell, & Way,
under review). Building on this research, the current work examined whether
acetaminophen also dampens intergroup positivity and negativity. We tested this
hypothesis across two studies, which used a double blind, placebo-controlled
design. In the first study, we gave participants acetaminophen or placebo and
then created novel groups with a classic minimal group paradigm. Next, we used
a reverse correlation procedure to visualize biases in mental representations of
ingroup and outgroup faces. The images generated from this procedure were
subsequently rated by an independent sample. The ratings indicated significantly
less ingroup positivity and outgroup negativity for participants given
acetaminophen compared to placebo. In a second study, we used a reverse
correlation procedure to examine effects of acetaminophen on mental
representations of African American faces. The resulting African American images
were then rated by an independent sample. Participants given acetaminophen
produced a less negative image of African Americans. This work suggests that
acetaminophen can blunt positivity and negativity in mental representations of
group members. More broadly, this work raises the possibility that commonly used
medications that modulate neurochemistry can influence how people respond in
intergroup situations.

THE INTEGRATION OF EMOTION AND COGNITION IN THE BRAIN Alexander
Shackman, University of Maryland -- Humans tend to experience cognition and
emotion as fundamentally different. Emotion is saturated with feelings of pleasure
or pain and manifests in readily discerned changes in the body. In contrast,
cognition often seems devoid of substantial hedonic, motivational, or somatic
features. These apparent differences in phenomenological experience and
peripheral physiology have led many to treat emotion and cognition as distinct
mental faculties. But newly available neurobiological data compel a
fundamentally different view. First, imaging studies demonstrate that negative
affect, pain, and cognitive control recruit overlapping regions of the midcingulate cortex (MCC). Second, anatomical studies reveal that the MCC
constitutes a hub where information about pain, threat, and other more abstract
kinds of potential punishment reinforcers can be synthesized and used to regulate
regions involved in expressing fear and anxiety, executing goal-directed
behaviors, and biasing the focus of attention. Finally, electrophysiological studies
indicate that emotion and cognition are functionally integrated in the MCC. Errors,

19

!
punishments, and other prompts for enhanced cognitive control are associated
with exaggerated MCC control signals in individuals prone to heightened
negative affect and the magnitude of these signals is, in turn, strongly predictive of
elevated behavioral inhibition and avoidance in future encounters. Collectively,
these observations suggest that a circuit centered on the MCC adaptively
controls thoughts, feelings, and behavior when there is uncertainty about actions
and their potentially aversive outcomes. More broadly, these findings provide
compelling evidence that emotion and cognition are deeply interwoven in the
fabric of the brain and provide a novel framework for understanding the nature of
temperament and the origins of psychopathology.

!

SALIENCE PROCESSING AND INSULAR CORTICAL FUNCTION AND DYSFUNCTION
Lucina Uddin, University of Miami -- The brain is constantly bombarded with
multiple sources of stimuli competing for attention. The relative salience of these
inputs determines which are selected for more in depth processing. The ‘salience
network’, with key nodes in the insular cortices, has a central role in the detection
of behaviorally relevant stimuli and the coordination of neural resources. Emerging
evidence suggests that atypical engagement of specific subdivisions of the insula
within the salience network is a feature of many neuropsychiatric disorders. I will
summarize recent findings from our lab using network analyses and dynamic
functional connectivity to examine the salience network in typical development
and neurodevelopmental disorders of social cognition including autism spectrum
disorder.

!
GETTING LOST IN A STORY AND ITS CONSEQUENCES FOR SOCIAL COGNITION AND
SHARED EXPERIENCE Dylan Wagner, The Ohio State University --When people
experience films and novels they almost invariably adopt the perspective of the
characters in the story. However, individuals differ in the degree to which they are
"transported" by the narrative of a particular story. In the present study,
participants (n=34) viewed the first thirty minutes of a popular Hollywood film while
undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging. Individual differences in
narrative transportation were positively correlated with activity in the dorsal medial
prefrontal cortex during scenes depicting social interactions. In addition, analysis
of the time series of cortical responses in the dorsal medial prefrontal cortex
demonstrated that individuals high in narrative transportation showed a greater
inter-subject correlation of time series compared to those low in narrative
transportation. These results suggest that transported subjects not only show
increased mentalizing during fictional social interactions but may also experience
the film's narrative in a similar fashion.

ABSTRACTS
SELF-ESTEEM MODULATES FRONTOSTRIATAL NETWORK INTERACTIONS SUPPORTING
SELF-EVALUATION AND SOCIAL COGNITION: STRUCTURAL, FUNCTIONAL, AND
LONGITUDINAL EVIDENCE Robert Chavez, Dartmouth College – Comprised of a
mixture of emotional, social, and self-referential components, the study of selfesteem occupies a unique intersection in the social and affective neurosciences.
Brain regions that support social and self-referential processing include areas
within medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) whereas valenced affective responses are
often reflected in subcortical activity in areas such as the ventral striatum. By
definition, the processes that give rise to self-esteem must incorporate evaluative
processing with information about the self. Here, we will present a line of evidence
indicating that the connectivity of these regions supports individual differences in
self-esteem. Using fMRI, functional connectivity between the MPFC and the ventral
striatum during positive self-evaluation was correlated with measures of state selfesteem reflecting transient feelings positive self-regard. Using diffusion tensor
imaging, we found that white matter integrity in tracts connecting the same
frontostriatal regions was correlated with individual differences in trait measures of
self-esteem reflecting self-esteem maintenance. Furthermore, we found that these
white matter connections predicted longitudinal polarization of self-esteem seven
months after initial scanning. Finally, in a dynamic emotion perception paradigm
we found that participants high in self-esteem showed greater MPFC activity to
positive facial expressions directed towards the self than directed away from the
self in areas with strong anatomical connectivity to the ventral striatum. Similar
connectivity results in other regions were not related to self-esteem in any of these
studies. Taken together, these results provide multimodal evidence that selfesteem is supported by frontostriatal circuits integrating positive affective with selfreferential processing.

DO YOU LIKE ME? DO YOU LIKE ME NOT?: THE NEURAL BASIS OF DECODING
AMBIGUOUS INTENT Taru Flagan, University of Texas at Austin -- When the intent of
another person could be positive or negative, how do we decode that
ambiguity? Much attention has been paid to neural systems of making mental
(versus non-mental) inferences about others, yet little is known about how the
content of a mental inference is decided. A model-based approach examines
the precise functions of regions involved in decoding ambiguous intent. Subjects
(n=27) underwent fMRI while decoding ambiguous (compared to positive or
negative) intentions of others. A Drift Diffusion Model estimated two processes
involved in ambiguity resolution: the extent to which the decision process begins
with an expectation that favors a positive or negative interpretation (i.e., starting
point) and the preferential accumulation of evidence in favor of one
interpretation (i.e., drift rate). The extent to which ambiguous intentions were
decoded using relatively positive starting points was associated with increased
VMPFC and amygdala activation and both regions showed decreased functional
connectivity with striatum. Relatively negative starting points were associated with
increased dACC activation which showed increased functional connectivity with
DLPFC. Preferential accumulation of negative evidence was associated with
inferior parietal lobule activity, whereas no regions showed a significant
relationship with preferential accumulation of positive evidence. These findings

21

!
suggest that decoding of ambiguous intent may be more strongly driven by one’s
expectations than accumulation of information in the moment. Amygdalastriatum and VMPFC-striatum connectivity may govern the influence of positive
expectations when decoding ambiguous social cues; dACC-DLPFC connectivity
may govern the influence of negative expectations.
THE EMBEDDING OF SOCIAL STATUS IN PERSON KNOWLEDGE: AN MVPA STUDY
Jessica Koski, Temple University -- Humans rapidly assign status information to
others based on a host of variables including career title, income, and reputation.
Status is so salient that it shapes our attention, judgment, and memory for other
people. Given the prominence of this variable in person processing, it seems
plausible that status information would be embedded within neural
representations of specific individuals. Here we asked whether person-specific
representations in ventral face-processing regions (occipital face area (OFA),
fusiform face area (FFA)) as well as more anterior regions (ventral anterior lobe
(vATL) and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC)) contain information about a person’s status.
The later regions were examined because prior work has shown that the ventral
ATLs are particularly sensitive to abstract person knowledge while patches in the
OFC are sensitive to the rewarding aspects of other people (see poster by Troiani
and Olson). Participants learned to associate names and status information (high
versus low ratings) with objects and faces over a two-day training regimen. These
stimuli were then presented in an fMRI experiment. We functionally localized face
and object sensitive regions using a separate localizer task. Multi-voxel pattern
analysis (MVPA) revealed that face and object sensitive regions in the ATLs and
lateral OFC decoded face and object status, respectively, whereas perceptual
regions like the FFA were not sensitive to social status. Our data suggest that
regions sensitive to abstract person knowledge and valuation interact during the
perception of social status, potentially contributing to the effects of status on
social perception.

!
FACING THE SELF OR FACING THE OTHER? INVESTIGATING ROLE OF RTPJ IN SELFOTHER DISTINCTION WITH TDCS Sophie Payne, Royal Holloway, University of London
-- Self-other discrimination is vital for self-awareness. Neuroimaging studies suggest
that both higher-level conceptual self-other discrimination tasks such as
perspective taking, as well as low-level face discrimination, recruit right
temporoparietal junction (rTPJ). There is an apparent contradiction in the literature
regarding the role of rTPJ in social cognition. Does rTPJ represent the self as distinct
from others, as face-recognition studies would suggest, or does it facilitate the self
“to become” another, as suggested by research on perspective taking? To
answer this question, participants performed a video morphing task in which their
own face morphed into, or out of, a familiar face, before and after stimulation of
rTPJ with transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) in a double-blind, shamcontrolled between groups design. Participants made a response when they
judged that the face started to look more like the person it was morphing into.
Depending on the direction of morphing, our task measured the assimilation of
other into the self representation, or the projection of the self onto other. Following
anodal stimulation, participants displayed a greater projection of self onto other.
This unidirectional effect may reflect a low-level mechanism of putting oneself into
someone else’s shoes, a mechanism that is essential for social cognition.

THE SOCIAL (NEURAL) NETWORK: A DATA-DRIVEN, MULTIVARIATE APPROACH TO
DECODING EPIGENETIC VARIABILITY IN THE OXYTOCIN RECEPTOR GENE Tyler
Santander, University of Virginia -- The human brain is a complex, hierarchical
dynamical system whose micro- and macroscale components interact to
produce myriad mental states. In a large sample (N>100) of healthy young adults,
we probed the macroscale neural network architecture underlying three aspects
of social perception: perception of animacy, biological motion, and emotional
faces. For each task, low-frequency regional BOLD timeseries were extracted from

22

!
90 anatomically-defined ROIs (via wavelet decomposition), and interregional
coherence was computed using the minimum variance distortionless response
method. We then applied graph and information theoretic measures to quantify
both network topology (e.g. nodal degree, clustering, and efficiency) and
nonlinear dynamics (e.g. approximate entropy). Finally, using a sparse Bayesian
learning technique for multivariate pattern recognition (relevance vector
regression), we attempted to decode inter-individual variability in DNA
methylation—a continuous molecular variable—on the oxytocin receptor gene
(OXTR) from these spatiotemporal network characteristics. On the microscale,
OXTR methylation mediates endogenous OXT action and thus pro-social
behavioral outcomes. Results show that several aspects of “social network”
topology and nonlinear dynamics significantly predict OXTR methylation. These
findings suggest that factors at the molecular level (i.e. DNA methylation) fine-tune
the action of the system by shaping overall network topology, which constrains
information flow between macroscale network components and therefore
determines the eventual “quality” of behavioral/mental states. This novel
approach to investigating the complex, hierarchical nature of the human brain
may ultimately offer critical insights into how abnormalities at the micro- and
macroscales of a system interact to produce disordered conditions such as
autism.

PERFUSION CHANGES IN THE VENTROMEDIAL PREFRONTAL CORTEX CURING AN
AFFECTIVE MEANING PROCESSING TASK PREDICT DECREASED UNPLEASANTNESS IN
DAILY LIFE EVENTS Elaine Shing, Wake Forest University -- In the brain-as-predictor
approach, neural activity is used to predict experiences in daily life, such as selfcontrol, relationship satisfaction, and mood disorder symptoms. We augment this
body of literature with a study investigating the relationship between the
ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), a region that has been consistently linked
to the experience of positive emotions and the downregulation of negative
emotions, and the temporal dynamics of affective processing in daily life events.
We hypothesized that state-related changes in vmPFC blood flow after an
emotional task would positively predict daily event pleasantness and negatively
predict unpleasantness. We assessed participants’ resting blood flow via an
arterial spin labeling perfusion scan before and after an emotional task (rating
positive and negative self-related statements). Participants then used the Day
Reconstruction Method to record daily events and rated the pleasantness and
unpleasantness throughout each event (i.e. beginning, middle, end, 15 minutes
after, 30 minutes after) for up to one week following the initial scan. We found that
pre-post blood flow changes in the vmPFC negatively predicted individuals'
subjective experiences of unpleasantness, particularly 15 and 30 minutes after the
end of each event, possibly reflecting their ability to recover from negative
responses to life events. Blood flow changes were unrelated to participants' ratings
of event pleasantness. These results provide ecological validity for the involvement
of the vmPFC in affective modulation and bolster the brain-as-predictor approach
as a useful method to link neuroscience findings with real-world psychological
outcomes.

VENTRAL MEDIAL PREFRONTAL CORTEX SUPPORTS A MULTIDIMENSIONAL CODE FOR
SIMILARITY TO SELF Mark Thornton, Harvard University -- One person can differ from
another in an almost infinite variety of ways. However, people make holistic
judgments of interpersonal similarity easily and naturally, and use similarity as a
basis for how to interact with others. How do perceivers integrate the vast array of
potential differences between self and other into a single representation of
similarity? One way their brains might accomplish this is through a multidimensional
code: within a single brain region, neural subpopulations would modulate activity
in response to different dimensions of similarity. The pattern of activity across the
region would thus represent overall similarity, despite the heterogeneous responses
of its subpopulations. To test this hypothesis, in the present study participants

23

!
underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging while they imagined
personally familiar others in a number of scenarios. Using representational similarity
analysis, we decoded the perceived similarity to self of these targets from patterns
of neural activity within ventral medial prefrontal cortex (vMPFC). This result is
highly consistent with earlier research implicating vMPFC in the representation of
similarity, making social inferences, and integrating information. Moreover, we
observed similarity-encoding patterns within a portion of vMPFC previously
demonstrated to be involved in self-reference. The effect remains robust even
when controlling for a wide range of other social variables. The presence of a
multidimensional code was further supported by the absence of parallel
univariate effects and the results of cross-validated factor analysis. These findings
support the hypothesis that similarity is represented in a deeply multidimensional,
rather than monolithic, way.
DISENTANGLING THE INNER WORKINGS OF EMOTIONAL EMPATHY IN TRAUMATIC
BRAIN INJURY PATIENTS Wanting Zhong, Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago &
Northwestern University -- Emotional empathy refers to the ability to share,
understand, and infer the emotional states of other people. It is crucial to social
interactions and prosocial behavior, but can be impaired in patients with brain
injury, affecting their daily social functions. Here, we investigated different
subcomponents of emotional empathy in a unique sample of 185 patients with
penetrating traumatic brain injury (pTBI), using the Balanced Emotional Empathy
Scale (BEES) as an emotional empathy measure. Exploratory factor analysis on the
scale items revealed two principal factors, one contributing to emotional
contagion and empathic concern (i.e. “It upsets me to see someone being
mistreated.”), and one contributing to affective perspective taking (i.e. “I cannot
relate to the crying and sniffling at weddings.”). Each factor score correlated with
a different aspect of Emotional Intelligence (EI), assessed with the Mayer-SaloveyCaruso Emotional Intelligence Test (MSCEIT). While the Emotional
Contagion/Empathic Concern factor was correlated with Experiential EI
(perceiving and using emotions), the Affective Perspective Taking factor was
correlated with Strategic EI (understanding and managing emotions). Stepwise
multiple regression analysis showed that Experiential EI and right insula damage
predicted the Emotional Contagion/Empathic Concern factor, while Strategic EI
and right vlPFC lesion predicted the Affective Perspective Taking factor, after
adjusting for pre-injury intelligence, depression, and total volume loss. These results
identified two different components of emotional empathy, showing that distinct
processes in perception and understanding of emotions may underlie these
components, and that each component was uniquely associated with a distinct
region within the empathy-related brain network.

ABSTRACTS
NEUROBIOLOGICAL PROFILES OF SOCIALLY ANXIOUS ADOLESCENTS AS THEY
ANTICIPATE AND RECEIVE JUDGMENTS FROM THEIR PEERS Eric Nelson, National
Institute of Mental Health – Adolescence is time of great changes in social
behavior which include a dramatic increase in salience of peers. Adolescence is
also a developmental period that is associated with a marked increase in social
anxiety. To get a better understanding of some of the neurobiological processes
that mediate adolescent social anxiety … my we developed a peer interaction
paradigm – the chatroom task – in which social decisions, assessments and
feedback in relation to peers is simulated in a neuroimaging environment. In
several implementations of this task we have uncovered a number of consistent
differences between socially anxious and non-anxious adolescents. These include
anxiety related bias to expect more negative judgments and deficits in memory
for positive social experiences. Neuroimaging findings included greater activation
in amygdala and striatum when contemplating and anticipating rejection related
decisions relative to acceptance related decisions. Finally, in a prediction error
based model we found a robust interaction in the striatum between anxiety,
approach decision, and feedback in the striatum – but only for socially anxious
adolescents. The PE related striatal activity related to subsequent memory
performance. Together these results represent a neurobiologically-based model
for how anxiety related cognitive biases may be manifest in neural circuits of the
adolescent brain.
MATERNAL BUFFERING OF HUMAN AMYGDALA-PREFRONTAL CIRCUITRY DURING
CHILDHOOD BUT NOT ADOLESCENCE Dylan Gee, Weill Cornell Medical College –
Mature amygdala-medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) circuitry provides regulation of
affect in adulthood; however, this circuitry is late to develop. Caregivers provide
potent regulation of affect in the absence of mature regulatory circuitry. The
present investigation examined a potential mechanism through which caregivers
provide regulatory influences in childhood. Children (n=23; ages: 4-10) showed
greater suppression of right amygdala reactivity in the presence of maternal
stimuli, which had no effect in adolescents (n=30; ages: 11-17; p=.049). In the
absence of maternal stimuli, children exhibited an immature connectivity pattern.
However, in the presence of maternal stimuli, connectivity exhibited a mature
pattern (i.e., negative connectivity) resembling the adolescent pattern
(mother/stranger x age interaction: p=.034). This finding suggests that children are
able to recruit more mature patterns of connectivity when in the presence of
maternal stimuli. Maternal effects on amygdala-mPFC circuitry were associated
with maternal buffering effects on behavior, such that affect-related regulation
during an emotional face go/nogo was improved when children were in the
presence of their mother (p=.015). Individual differences emerged such that
greater maternal influence on amygdala-mPFC circuitry was associated with
lower separation anxiety, more secure attachment, and more modulation of
behavioral regulation by the mother in daily life. Taken together, the present
findings suggest a neural mechanism through which caregivers modulate
children’s regulatory behavior by inducing a mature pattern of amygdalaprefrontal connectivity and buffering against heightened amygdala reactivity.

25

!
Maternal buffering in childhood, but not adolescence, suggests that childhood
may be a sensitive period for amygdala-prefrontal development.

SCARCITY ALTERS THE NEURAL ENCODING OF BLACK FACES: EVIDENCE FOR A
DEHUMANIZATION ACCOUNT OF RACIAL BIAS UNDER ECONOMIC STRESS Amy
Krosch, New York University – When the economy declines, racial discrimination
typically increases. Previously, we found that scarcity promotes discriminatory
resource allocation through altered perception of Black Americans as darker and
more “stereotypically Black.” Given historical and empirical links between
blackness and dehumanization, we asked whether perceivers dehumanize Black
Americans in order to justify giving them fewer scarce resources. Although
dehumanization is a complex construct, its visual component is literally the degree
to which a face is perceived as a face. We tested whether scarcity impedes visual
processing of Black faces using the N170 component of the event-related
potential, a neural index of face encoding that occurs approximately 170 ms after
face presentation. Indeed, when resources were framed as scarce, as opposed to
neutral, participants’ N170 response was delayed to Black relative to White faces,
with longer delays associated with greater anti-Black allocation bias in behavior.
These findings indicate that resource scarcity may motivate perceivers to see
Black faces as less face-like, suggesting a visual “dehumanization” account for
scarcity effects on behavioral discrimination, and a new mechanism through
which economic stress might exacerbate racial inequality.

!
THE PHARMACOLOGICAL DISSECTION OF AFFILIATION Jennifer Bartz, McGill
University – It is widely accepted that humans have a fundamental “need to
belong” and that thwarted belonging needs can result in both mental and
physical ill-being. Moreover, to be health promoting, at least some of our
relationships need to be close and enduring. Although the biological mechanisms
that support the various components of human affiliation are not well understood,
work in non-human animals highlights the oxytocin and opioid systems. One way in
which oxytocin is thought to facilitate bonding is by increasing the rewarding and
reinforcing properties of conspecifics and social interactions (via interactions with
the mesolimbic dopamine system). Alternately, endogenous opioids—which are
associated with the experience of liking, pleasure, gratification and well-being—
are thought to facilitate affiliation by modulating the pleasure we experience
when socially connected and pain we experience when socially disconnected
(which, should prompt socially motivated behavior to restore well-being). In this
talk, I will discuss recent work using pharmacological probes including Syntocinon
(synthetic oxytocin), and Naltrexone (an opiate antagonist) to “dissect” the
neurochemical pathways that mediate key dimensions of affiliation in humans,
highlighting the distinct contributions of the oxytocin and opioid systems. The
notion that oxytocin may be important for the initiation and opioids may be
important for the maintenance of close bonds will be discussed.

PHASE-LOCKING AND COHERENCE
DURING PERSPECTIVE TAKING PREDICT
ENHANCED PREDICTION ACCURACY FOR
COUNTER-STEREOTYPIC CHOICES IN OUTGROUP MEMBERS Kelly A. Duran-Jordan -

University of Delaware; Adam B. Magerman University of Delaware; Chad E. Forbes University of Delaware – Extant research
suggests our brains are designed for one
primary function: prediction. We inherently
rely on past experiences, knowledge and
situational cues to predict what responses will
engender successful navigation through
complex social environments. Despite the
fundamental importance of prediction
accuracy, people tend to be quite inept at
predicting other’s behaviors. This is
particularly likely when predicting out-group
behaviors, which can be biased by
inaccurate, stereotype-consistent
information. To the extent that accurate
knowledge for out-group members can
increase prediction accuracy for out-group
behaviors, facilitating efficacious encoding
of counter-stereotypic information may be
one means of increasing prediction
accuracy for out-group behaviors. One way
this may be achieved is via perspective
taking. Past research suggests that
perspective taking can be an effective
means of promoting encoding of counterstereotypic information, likely via exploiting
the well-known self-reference effect. The
present study examined this question directly
by investigating whether perspective taking
enhanced one’s ability to accurately predict
out-group behaviors. White participants selfidentified as either Democrats or
Republicans, viewed photos of political and
ethnic (Latino) in-group or out-group
members. These photos were accompanied
by information containing either stereotypic
or counter-stereotypic political viewpoints.
Continuous EEG activity was recorded while
white participants completed a prediction
task. Participants viewed the information
from either the perspective of out-group
members or objectively. Time frequency
analysis, revealed interesting interactions
occurring during the perspective taking
condition that is unique to viewing Latino
Republicans. Posterior Cingulate Cortex

(PCC) -Medial Prefrontal Cortex (MPFC)
phase-locking and coherence was
associated with greater accuracy for
counter-stereotypical predictions only.

University – Theory of mind (ToM) is the ability
to attribute mental states and beliefs to
others. Previous research suggests that
children can perform traditional ToM tasks,
e.g. false belief tasks, between 4 and 5 years
of age, across cultures. We modified Saxe &
Kanwisher’s (2003 ) short story tasks to
investigate the neural mechanisms of ToM
using false-belief and false photographs
conditions in typically developing children
ages 8 through 13 (Dodell-Feder et al 2011).
The stories in this modified task were at a
grade 3 reading level as determined by the
Flesch-Kincaid readability index. In this group
of children, we saw recruitment of social
cognitive areas during the ToM task,
specifically the superior temporal gyrus,
superior temporal sulcus, and somatomotor
cortices . These findings confirm our
hypothesis that the downward extension of
this task is a valid measure of ToM in this age
group. Additionally, we found that ToM
activation relates to the behavioral measures
of social cognition and social functioning in
this group, suggesting that differences in the
recruitment of the ToM network may be
mediating social cognition and social
functioning differences in children.

THE NEURAL CORRELATES OF INFANTS
FALSE BELIEF PROCESSING: AN ERP STUDY

Maria Crespo - Lancaster University; Vincent
Reid - Lancaster University; Elena Geangu Lancaster University – It is widely accepted
that children develop false belief reasoning
around the age of 4, when they pass verbal
false belief tasks (e.g. Perner et al., 2005).
However, more recent studies using
behavioural non-verbal false belief tasks
have suggested that infants can pass them
(e.g. Onishi et al., 2005). However, it is yet
unknown whether infant’s performance in
these tasks relies on similar processes as those

28

!
needed for the classic false belief test. Our
study aims to address this gap by
investigating the neural correlates of infant
belief processing. Interestingly, in adults and
children, explicit and implicit false belief tasks
elicit similar event-related potential (ERP)
responses, characterized by a frontal-parietal
distributed late slow wave –LSW– (e.g.
Bowman et al., 2011; Liu et al., 2009;
Sabbagh et al., 2000), suggesting that they
tap into the same cognitive construct
(Geangu et al., 2013; Kuhn-Popp et al., 2013).
Using the same task as Geangu et al. (2013),
we presented 15-month-old infants (N=15)
with image sequences depicting a
character according to her true (TB) or false
(FB) beliefs about reality, while EEG was
continuously recorded. ERPs time-locked to
the onset of the last image were analysed
with respect to the effect of belief
(true/false) and laterality (right/midline/left).
The results revealed that parietally (7001000ms), FB evoke a more positive LSW (M=
2.150µV) compared to TB (M= -2.746µV),
(F(1,14)= 9.981, p=.007). No significant effects
were found at frontal locations. Results will be
further discussed in terms of their implications
for understanding infant belief processing
development.

IMPAIRED THEORY OF MIND IN AUTISM
MAY STEM FROM DISRUPTED
COMPUTATION OF OTHERS’ INTENTIONS

Isabelle Rosenthal - Wellesley College; Cendri
A. Hutcherson - California Institute of
Technology; John P. O'Doherty - California
Institute of Technology; Ralph Adolphs California Institute of Technology; Damian
Stanley - California Institute of Technology –
Inferring the beliefs and intentions of others
(Theory of Mind; ToM) is critical for social
cognition. Impaired ToM is a common
characteristic of Autism Spectrum Disorder
(ASD), but how the underlying processes are
disrupted remains unknown. We addressed
this question using a novel task that permits
computational modeling of ToM learning
processes, while retaining the core features
of traditional ToM tasks. Participants
(Mentalizers) learned the beliefs and
intentions of others (Agents) by observing
them make a series of donation decisions for
three different charities. Critically, the
experiment had 2 modes. In ‘Normal’ mode,
Agents’ decisions were implemented with
probability p=0.65 and reversed with

probability p=0.35. In ‘Reversal’ mode the
opposite was true, inducing Agents to antichoose to get their desired outcomes. The
mode switched occasionally and
unpredictably. Thus, to correctly predict
Agent choices (ag_Choice), Mentalizers had
to track Agent belief (ag_Belief) about the
mode and the Agent’s idiosyncratic
intentions towards each charity (ag_Intent).
While controls (N=47; matched for age,
gender, education and IQ) learned to
predict ag_Belief, ag_Intent, and ag_Choice
at above chance levels, high-functioning
adults with ASD (N=23) could only track
ag_Belief (which did not require ToM).
Furthermore, a Rescorla-Wagner type
learning model accurately predicted control,
but not ASD, performance. Interestingly, both
groups integrated stated estimates of belief
and intent to generate choice predictions,
suggesting that ToM-reasoning, but not intent
learning, remained intact in ASD. Our new
task elucidates specific computations
through which we learn about other people
and suggests a more nuanced
understanding of ToM impairment in ASD.

PEER INFLUENCE AND SOCIAL
COGNITION DURING ADOLESCENT
DIGITAL MEDIA USE Lauren Sherman -

UCLA; Leanna Hernandez - UCLA; Patricia
Greenfield - UCLA; Mirella Dapretto - UCLA –
Previous research has demonstrated that
adolescents are susceptible to peer
influence on social media. We investigated
the specific role played by “quantifiable
online social endorsement” – e.g., “likes” or
“favorites”—a ubiquitous feature of modern
online environments that has nonetheless
been little studied. Adolescents underwent
an fMRI scan while using a tool that mimics
the social photo-sharing app Instagram: they
viewed photographs which had ostensibly
been “liked” by peers, including their own
photos, and decided whether to “like” each
photograph. In truth, the number of likes
appearing with each photograph was
experimentally manipulated such that 50%
had 25-50 likes (“popular”) and 50% had
fewer than 25 likes (“unpopular”).
Participants were significantly more likely to
“like” popular photos and refrain from “liking”
unpopular photos than predicted by chance
(p <.00001). Viewing both one’s own and
others’ images with many vs. few likes was
associated with significant activation in
regions of the Mentalizing Network, including

29

!
the bilateral temperoparietal junction and
posterior cingulate cortex. The reverse
contrast (viewing photos with “few” vs.
“many” likes) yielded no significant
activation in either case. Viewing one’s own
images with many vs. few likes also activated
reward circuitry (e.g., nucleus accumbens
and orbitofrontal cortex). However, reward
circuitry was not recruited while viewing
others’ popular photos. Our behavioral and
neuroimaging findings suggest that
quantifiable online social endorsement is a
means by which peer influence can occur in
online environments, and that recruitment of
regions implicated in social cognition may
underlie adolescents’ sensitivity to this subtle
indicator of peer opinion.

FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY DURING
ANTISMOKING MESSAGES PREDICTS
BEHAVIOR CHANGE Nicole Cooper University of Pennsylvania; Steven Tompson University of Michigan; Matthew Brook
O'Donnell - University of Pennsylvania; Emily
Falk - University of Pennsylvania – Recent
neuroimaging studies have demonstrated
that activity in medial prefrontal cortex
(MPFC) during exposure to persuasive
messages can predict health behavior
change. This brain-behavior predictive
relationship has been particularly linked to
regions of MPFC previously associated with
self-related processing and valuation.
However, this work has focused almost
exclusively on MPFC, rather than expanding
to investigate functional networks. Here, we
examine the functional interactions between
MPFC and other regions during exposure to
antismoking messages. Forty-three adult
smokers underwent functional magnetic
resonance imaging (fMRI) while viewing 60
antismoking images. Thirty images illustrated
strong negative consequences of smoking
(i.e., a tracheotomy). The remaining 30
images were compositionally similar, but
neutral. As a metric of behavior change,
participants reported how many cigarettes
they smoked per day before the scan, and
again one month later. Functional
connectivity was estimated for the negative
consequence versus neutral images, from a
seed region in MPFC functionally localized by
a self-related processing task. This
connectivity difference was related to
individual differences in smoking reduction
over the next month. We found that stronger
functional connectivity between MPFC and

affective processing regions such as ventral
striatum, anterior cingulate, and insula, as
well as executive function (lateral prefrontal
cortex), and action planning (supplemental
motor area) regions, in negative versus
neutral images, predicts larger reductions in
smoking. This suggests that increased
connectedness between these
neurocognitive processes during exposure to
emotional health appeals is a precursor of
behavior change. Future work will further
explore the relationships between these
previously unidentified regions and behavior
change.

A SURVEY OF SIMULTANEOUS BEHAVIOR
CHANGES Seth J. Kallman - Columbia
University; Kevin N. Ochsner - Columbia
University – Psychologists have identified a
range of techniques to help regulate our
daily habits, such as reappraisal, distraction,
and implementation intentions. While these
strategies have successfully improved
outcomes for a variety of behaviors, few
studies have examined what occurs when
individuals attempt to regulate many
behaviors simultaneously. With this in mind,
we performed a survey to assess base rates
of desired and attempted changes. We also
examined whether the number, percentage,
or success of desired changes attempted
was associated with positive life outcomes.
To this end, 100 participants saw a list of 33
common behaviors (e.g. watching television,
having caffeine). They were asked if they
would like to change how much they
engaged in the behavior and if they would
like to do it more or less. If they did want to
change their activity frequency, we asked if
they were taking any active steps towards
this goal and had them rate how successful
these efforts had been. Finally, they
completed short questionnaires assessing
subjective well-being, perceived stress, and
self-esteem. We will first present descriptive
data showing desired and attempted
changes across all the activities. On the
whole, these results were remarkably similar
to lay ideas about which behaviors might be
considered ‘vices’ or ‘virtues.’ We will also
show correlational evidence that regulatory
success, rather than the number or
percentage of desired changes attempted,
was most strongly related to positive life
outcomes. Overall, these results may hold
interesting implications for our understanding
of simultaneous self-regulatory attempts.

NEURAL CORRELATES OF VIEWING SELF
VS. OTHER-AUTHORED PERSUASIVE
MESSAGES Jordan L. Livingston - University of
Oregon; Rita M. Ludwig - University of
Oregon; Danielle Cosme - University of
Oregon; Anne Hill - New York University; Emily
B. Falk - University of Pennsylvania; Elliot T.
Berkman, University of Oregon – Evidence
increasingly suggests that goals that have
higher self-relevance are more likely to be
achieved. Moreover, activity in self-related
regions is often predictive of successful
behavior change (Cooper et al., in press).
However, the neural mechanisms by which
self-relevant information gets translated into
effective self-regulation, and the extent to
which neural processing of self-relevant
information differs from other forms of
persuasive communication remains unclear.
To further understand the neural mechanisms
behind self-relevant persuasion, we
investigated the role of self-authored (i.e.,
highly self-relevant) messages in predicting
smoking cessation. Participants (N=17) were
smokers from the surrounding community
who reported a desire to quit smoking. First,
participants completed a behavioral session
in which they generated short, self-relevant
text messages that they believed would help
them to quit smoking in the subsequent
weeks. One week later, in an fMRI scan
session, participants viewed these messages,
as well as messages generated by experts
and by yoked others, and rated each
message for helpfulness. Participants were
subsequently assigned to a 30-day textmessaging intervention in which they
received text messages from one of the
three conditions. Quitting success was
measured at the end of the intervention.
Preliminary results on a subset of subjects
suggest that viewing self-generated vs.
other-generated messages recruits greater
activity in typical self-relevant (vmPFC) and
self-regulation regions (bilateral vlPFC),
suggesting a mechanism by which selfrelevant information might influence selfregulation success. Further data collection
and analysis are in progress. The content of
self-relevant messages and helpfulness
ratings for the self-relevant messages will also
be discussed.

SELF-PROCESSING DURING MESSAGE
VIEWING PREDICTS INTERVENTION

EFFICACY Rita M. Ludwig - University of

Oregon; Jordan L. Livingston - University of
Oregon; Dani Cosme - University of Oregon;
Anne Hill - New York University; Emily B. Falk University of Pennsylvania; Elliot T. Berkman University of Oregon – Relevance of a
message to the self is a key component in its
effectiveness in producing behavioral
change. Self-relevant messaging activates
the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC), and
activation of the MPFC has been shown to
predict health behavior change (Falk et al.,
2011). In the present research we unite and
extend these findings to investigate whether
neural activation changes as a function of
the degree of self-relevance and whether
that activation predicts behavioral change
in response to a message-based intervention.
We operationalize self-relevance as inverse
of the psychological distance of the
message author to the self, hypothesizing
that neural activation in response to
messages generated by oneself (no
distance) will be a better predictor of
behavioral change as compared to
activation in response to messages
generated by one’s peer (some) and an
unfamiliar other (large). Participants (N=17) in
this study were smokers attempting to quit.
Participants generated self-directed quitting
messages and completed a pre-intervention
measure of smoking, exhaled carbon
monoxide (CO). One week later participants
viewed self-, peer-, and unknown othergenerated messages while undergoing fMRI
scanning; following this session they were
randomly assigned to author condition and
received these messages via SMS for 30 days.
At this intervention’s end CO was again
recorded as a measure of behavioral
change. Preliminary results suggest that
neural activation patterns do respond to
author distance, with regions related to selfand self-regulation (MPFC, paracingulate
cortex) being preferentially activated
participants in the self-generated condition.
Further analysis will use this neural data to
predict intervention efficacy.

NEURAL PATTERN SIMILARITY IN FRONTAL
CORTEX FOR HEALTH MESSAGES: A
REPRESENTATIONAL SIMILARITY ANALYSIS

!
Pennsylvania – Recent neuroscience
research has suggested that a variety of
social and motivational stimulus
characteristics are represented as distributed
patterns of neural activity rather than by the
overall (mean) response of a given region.
Although distinct patterns of activity have
been found in frontal cortex for social
rewards, monetary value, and even
personality traits, variation in neural patterns
of activity between naturalistic health
messages have not been examined. In the
present investigation, adult smokers (n=43)
underwent fMRI while viewing 60 antismoking
images. Thirty images illustrated strong
negative consequences of smoking (i.e., a
tracheotomy). The remaining 30 images
were compositionally similar, but emotionally
neutral. For each subject, the pattern of
neural activity within medial frontal cortex
(MPFC) was estimated for each image item,
and pairwise Pearson correlations were
calculated for all item pairs. We found
significantly greater dissimilarity in the neural
representations of items with the same
valence when compared to the similarity of
items across valence type (e.g. one negative
item and one neutral item). Furthermore, this
dissimilarity of within-valence items was
driven specifically by high emotion (strongly
negatively valenced) items, meaning that
there was less neural similarity between two
negative items than there was between a
negative and compositionally similar neutral
item. Given that emotional health messages
are often more effective than neutral
counterparts, it may be the case that
representational range of neural patterns in
MFPC could reflect behaviorally relevant
characteristics of naturalistic messages and
ultimately provide insight into the predictive
relationship between brain and behavior.

THE MERE GREEN EFFECT: AN FMRI STUDY
OF PRO-ENVIRONMENTAL
ADVERTISEMENTS Stephanie Vezich - UCLA;

Benjamin C. Gunter - UCLA; Matthew D.
Lieberman - UCLA – Self-report evidence
overwhelmingly suggests that consumers
prefer green products (i.e. pro-environmental
products) to standard products. However,
there appears to be little correspondence
between these measures and actual
purchase behaviors. As an initial step to
better understand this disconnect, we
exposed participants in an MRI scanner to
green and standard ads matched on the

product. After viewing each ad, participants
indicated to what extent they liked the ad
and to what extent they thought the
company was sustainable. We found that
while participants report that they like green
ads more than control ads and think they are
more sustainable, the fMRI data suggest an
opposite pattern. In particular, participants
showed greater activation in regions
associated with positive evaluations and
reward (ventromedial prefrontal cortex and
ventral striatum) in response to control ads
relative to green ads. When looking at the
relationship between self-reported attitudes
and neural activity in reward-related regions
for each ad specifically, we found a positive
correlation for control ads but no relationship
for green ads. In other words, participants
showed greater activity in reward-related
regions to the extent that they also reported
liking control ads, but there was no such
trend for green ads. Taken together, our
results suggest that self-report can accurately
gauge private preferences when no social
desirability concerns are at play. However,
private preferences may differ when the
message is less mundane. In these contexts,
other methods may better track downstream
behaviors. Potential directions for future
research in this domain are discussed.

Medical Center, Children’s Mercy Hospital;
S.N. Balakrishnan - University of Missouri-Rolla;
Amanda S. Bruce - University of Kansas
Medical Center, Children’s Mercy Hospital –
Parental feeding practices shape children’s
lifelong food preferences. Even when a
parent chooses a healthy option for a child,
s/he may make an unhealthy choice for
him/herself. Thus, advancing our
understanding of the neuroscientific
foundations of parental food choices for
children may provide valuable information
about development of health-related
behaviors more generally. The objectives of
this functional MRI project are to determine
the computational and neural mechanisms
underlying parental food decision-making
processes for their children. Twenty-five
mothers (mean age 38.3 years) with children
ages 8-14 made a series of food choices for

32

!
60 items (= eat or not eat) in two different
conditions (own choices; choices for child)
after providing separate taste and health
ratings for each item. Our results showed
dissociable behavioral and neural patterns
between the two conditions. Moms used
both taste (b=.49) and health (b=.46) values
when they made their own food choices.
These were positively correlated with activity
in ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC)
and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC),
respectively. Interestingly, when participants
made choices for what they want their child
to eat, decision weight for taste values
(b=.25) was decreased, while decision
weight for health values (b=.54) was
increased. vmPFC activation was negatively
correlated with the mom’s taste values, while
dlPFC did not show significant correlation
with mom’s health values. Results suggest
mothers use distinct neurofunctional
mechanisms when making food decisions for
child and self.

STRUCTURAL CONNECTIVITY BETWEEN
EXECUTIVE CONTROL AND REWARD
REGIONS CONTRIBUTES TO INDIVIDUAL
DIFFERENCES IN BODY FAT PERCENTAGE
Pin-Hao A. Chen - Dartmouth College;
Robert S. Chavez - Dartmouth College; Todd
F. Heatherton - Dartmouth College –
Successful self-regulation relies on the
balance between executive control and
reward (Heatherton & Wagner, 2011). Using
functional neuroimaging, researchers have
characterized this balance as reflecting
variability in functional connectivity between
these two systems (Wagner, Altman, Boswell,
Kelley, & Heatherton, 2013). However, being
functionally connected implies that these
two systems are also structurally connected.
It is also possible that individual differences in
structural connectivity may reflect long-term
self-regulatory outcomes. Accordingly, we
examined whether the structural integrity
between the two systems reflects individual
variability in body fat percentage. Thirty-six
chronic dieters completed a food-cue
reactivity task after undergoing cognitive
depletion in the scanner. Using fMRI, ROIs for
the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) that engages
during cognitive control and for the
orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) that represents
reward were defined using activation
patterns from a food-cue reactivity task. A
white matter tract connecting these two

ROIs was identified across subjects using
diffusion tensor imaging and probability
tractography. We then quantified the white
matter integrity by extracting each
participant’s fractional anisotropy values
from this white matter tract. Individuals who
had the greatest white matter integrity
between the IFG and OFC were those who
had the lowest body fat percentages (r = 0.38, p = 0.03). This suggests that structural
integrity between these two regions may
play a role in achieving long-term success in
self-regulation.

RESPONSE INHIBITION ACTIVITY
ASSOCIATED WITH SOCIOECONOMIC
STATUS Christopher N. Cascio - University of

Pennsylvania; Gwendolyn M. Lawson University of Pennsylvania; Martha J. Farah University of Pennsylvania; Emily B. Falk University of Pennsylvania – Health and
educational disparities have long been
associated with socioeconomic status (SES),
and recent research suggests that some of
these disparities may arise as the result of SES
effects on brain development. The aim of the
current study is to extend our understanding
of SES and brain function in young people by
examining individual differences in the
response inhibition network (right inferior
frontal gyrus and basal ganglia). Adolescent
males (N=71) between the ages of 16-17
were recruited from the Michigan
Department of State Driver Database as part
of a larger multi-study project examining
adolescent driving behavior. Participants
completed self-report measures of SES
(parental education and subjective social
status [SSS]) and an fMRI go/no-go task.
Neither measure of SES in the full sample
predicted no-go inhibitory performance,
however SES effects were observed in the
response inhibition network during inhibitory
trials. Parents’ education significantly
correlated with activity in the response
inhibition network, controlling for task
performance, t(64)=2.55, β=.30, p=.013. The
association between parents’ education
and response inhibition network activity was
primarily driven by father’s education,
t(61)=3.60, β=.42, p<.001. SSS measures were
not available for all subjects but for the 35
who filled out US and community ladders,
community status was also predictive,
t(31)=2.51, β=.41, p=.018. The current results
demonstrate that holding performance
constant, adolescents of lower SES, as

33

!
defined by parental education (particularly
father’s), show less responsivity in the
response inhibition network during a go/nogo task. Overall, these results reveal SES
differences in neural inhibitory control even
when behavioral performance is equivalent.

ENHANCING PREFRONTAL CORTEX
FUNCTION REDUCES IMPULSIVITY BUT NOT
RISK-TAKING DURING COST-BENEFIT
DECISION-MAKING Ann L. Carroll - Harvard

University; Jeffrey Edwards - Harvard
University; Ekaterina Pivovarova Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard
Medical School; Joshua W. Buckholtz Harvard University, Massachusetts General
Hospital – A wealth of preclinical and human
data suggests that dysregulated
corticostriatal circuit function contributes to
poor self-control. In particular, drug studies,
fMRI and receptor imaging work indicate
that heightened reward-related striatal
dopamine transmission may predispose
impulsive decision-making across a range of
psychopathologies, including substance
abuse and antisocial behavior. A parallel
literature comprising lesion and functional
imaging studies implicates prefrontal cortex
(PFC) hypofunction in poor impulse control.
The association between impulsivity, striatal
hyper-reactivity and prefrontal hyporeactivity is especially intriguing given that
prefrontal cortex is known to negatively
regulate phasic dopamine transmission in the
striatum. We have previously suggested that
impulse control deficits may arise from an
imbalance between excitatory bottom-up
(midbrain) and inhibitory top-down (PFC)
influences on striatal activity and consequent
encoding of action values. If this hypothesis is
correct, enhancing prefrontal cortex
function should reduce impulsivity, and this
effect should be striatum-dependent. Here,
we provide behavioral data showing that
boosting prefrontal cortex with excitatory
non-invasive brain stimulation is associated
with increased self-control during
intertemporal choice. We used anodal
transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS)
to increase the excitability of left dorsolateral
prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) while participants
indicated their preference for a sooner-butsmaller versus a larger-but-delayed monetary
reward (delay discounting). To test for costselective effects of PFC tDCS, we also

included an equal number of trials in which
participants had to choose between certainbut-smaller and larger-but-risky trials
(probabilistic discounting). Fifty-four
participants (30 active, 24 sham) were tested
twice - during, and 10 minutes immediately
following a 30-minute tDCS stimulation
session. We found that, compared to sham,
active stimulation increased self-control (as
indexed by the frequency of larger-but-later
choices). This effect was not only evident
post-stimulation, but was significantly
stronger, suggesting that excitatory tDCS
may have some carry-over effects on choice
behavior that continue even after the acute
period of stimulation. Of note, we did not
observe any impact of PFC tDCS on
probabilistic decision-making. This suggests
that the effect of upregulating prefrontal
cortex function on cost-benefit decisionmaking may be selective for delay costs. Our
findings show that boosting prefrontal cortex
function enhances impulse control without
affecting risk-taking, providing causal
evidence supporting the notion that these
distinct facets of self-control have dissociable
neurobiological architectures.

COMMON AND DISTINCT NEURAL
CORRELATES OF POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE
OUTCOMES Christina H. Lee - University of

Toronto; Damla Kerestecioglu - University of
Toronto; Andrew A. Jahn - Indiana University;
William A. Cunningham - University of Toronto
– Previous research supports the idea that
positive and negative representations are
dissociable at the neural level. Areas
associated with representing positive
information are the medial prefrontal cortex
(mPFC) and nucleus accumbens (NAcc),
while areas associated with representing
negative information are the lateral
prefrontal cortex (lPFC) and anterior
cingulate cortex (ACC). However, areas
encoding reward have also been shown to
decrease activation relative to baseline
when presented with a punishment,
suggesting the non-independence of
evaluative processes. A novel duplex
gambling task was used to determine how
the presentation of monetary rewards and
punishments are represented in the
prefrontal cortex using functional magnetic
resonance imaging (fMRI). Participants were
required to take or pass a monetary gamble
comprising of both positive and negative
information. The gamble had 4 possible

34

!
outcomes: (1) gain the positive value, (2) lose
the negative value, (3) receive both the
positive and negative value, or (4) receive
neither. The analysis revealed that receiving
a good outcome was associated with
increased activation in medial prefrontal
areas, NAcc and hippocampus, while
receiving a bad outcome was associated
with increased activation in lateral prefrontal
areas and ACC. In addition, the interaction
of good and bad outcome was associated
with activation changes in lPFC and
orbitofrontal areas. This provides additional
evidence for at least a partial dissociation
between the processing of positive and
negative outcomes.

POSITIVE AUTOBIOGRAPHICAL MEMORY
RETRIEVAL REDUCES IMPULSIVITY Karolina
M. Lempert - New York University; Megan E.
Speer - Rutgers University; Mauricio R.
Delgado - Rutgers University; Elizabeth A.
Phelps - New York University – Choices
between immediate and future rewards, or
intertemporal choices, are prevalent in
everyday life. Impulsive intertemporal
choices underlie societal problems like
addiction and obesity. One way to increase
patience is to imagine positive future
experiences. This may be difficult, however,
since the future is inherently less vivid than
the past. Another potential way may be to
remember positive past events. There is
overlap in the neural networks associated
with simulating future events and
remembering past experiences, but can
recalling memories lead to more patient
choices? On Day 1 of our two-day study,
participants wrote about positive past
autobiographical events. On Day 2 (three
days later), they performed an intertemporal
choice task with two block types – in the
“memory” blocks, they mentally simulated
the memories that they wrote about on Day
1 before making intertemporal choices (e.g.,
“$10 today or $15 in 7 days?”). In the control
blocks, they relaxed and attended to their
current state before making intertemporal
choices. We quantified discounting rates (a
measure of impulsivity) separately in the
memory and control conditions. Although
participants faced the same decisions in the
two conditions, they were more patient after
simulating positive past experiences (N=33;
t=2.47; p=0.01). A follow-up study revealed
the effect was specific for positive, not
negative memories (N=31; t=1.12; p=0.27). It

was also driven by autobiographical memory
recall, not just imagination of positive scenes
(N=31; t=0.9; p=0.38). This work introduces a
potential manipulation for reducing
impulsivity, and it provides insight into the
neural mechanisms underlying intertemporal
choice.

MINDFUL OF YOUR MISTAKES?
DISPOSITIONAL MINDFULNESS INCREASES
CORRUGATOR SUPERCILII REACTIVITY TO
SELF-CONTROL FAILURE Nathaniel W. Elkins-

Brown - University of Toronto; Blair Saunders University of Toronto; Michael Inzlicht University of Toronto – Previous studies have
documented the positive effects of
mindfulness on self-control. But what
mechanisms underlie these improvements?
Emerging research in social and affective
neuroscience has proposed that task-related
negative affect (NA) drives the up-regulation
of self-control. If this were the case, we would
expect that personality traits that influence
NA, such as dispositional mindfulness, should
moderate psychophysiological correlates of
NA during self-control processes. In our study,
70 participants completed an inhibitory
control task while we simultaneously
measured an event-related potential (ERP)
associated with error-monitoring (the errorrelated negativity [ERN]), and
electromyographic (EMG) activity over the
corrugator supercilii, the principle muscle
involved in frowning. Corrugator activity was
amplified within 200ms of error responses and
this effect was positively associated with
mindful acceptance, but was not associated
with any other measurements of self-control
or personality. These results provide further
evidence that task-related negative affect is
integral to self-control processes, and that
this relationship is shaped by the tendency to
not regulate moment-to-moment thoughts
and emotions.

NEURAL ACTIVATION AND FUNCTIONAL
CONNECTIVITY DURING EXTINCTION
LEARNING WITH APPETITIVE AND
AVERSIVE CONDITIONED STIMULI Andrea

H. Lewis - Rutgers University; David V. Smith Rutgers University; Heena Manglani - Rutgers
University; Mauricio R. Delgado - Rutgers
University – Extinction learning involves new
learning or updating of previously formed
associations between a conditioned stimulus

35

!
(CS) and an affective unconditioned stimulus
(US). The ability to extinguish CS-US
associations is essential in instances where CS
exhibit excessive, maladaptive influences on
behavior (e.g. fear in PTSD). Recent research
suggests that the medial prefrontal cortex
(mPFC) plays an active role in extinction
learning with both positive and negative CS,
given its anatomical connections with
affective learning regions such as the
striatum and the amygdala. However, the
functional relationship between these
regions and major networks in the brain
during extinction learning remains unclear.
The current study used fMRI to examine
functional connectivity of affective learning
regions with various brain networks, looking
specifically at how this connectivity differed
for acquisition of CS-US associations as
compared to extinction of these
associations. Over the course of extinction,
several regions of the striatum as well as
mPFC showed changes in activation as a
function of factors such as stimulus valence
and stimulus magnitude. These regions also
exhibited differences in functional
connectivity with the executive control
network (ECN) during acquisition as
compared to extinction. In particular, both
the ventral striatum and the mPFC showed
increased connectivity with the ECN during
extinction. Our findings highlight how
extinction learning is orchestrated by the
interplay between the mPFC and its
interconnected brain regions.

FUNCTION IN DYSFUNCTION:
DISSOCIATION AS A COGNITIVE
STRATEGY IN DIVIDED ATTENTION
CONDITIONS Jenn K. Lewis - University of

Oregon; Katia L. Krane - University of Oregon;
Mary-Ann Dobrota - University of Oregon;
Don M. Tucker - Electrical Geodesics, Inc. –
Defined by a lack of integration between
thoughts, feelings, identity, and or
experiences, dissociation is a mechanism,
often recognized as a learned or habituated
dysfunctional response to environmental
experiences, particularly those of stress and
threat. However, a small body of behavioral
research has suggested that dissociative
tendencies may hold a cognitive advantage
in specific situations, such as divided
attention conditions. Despite having a
potential effect on multiple domains of
cognition, little is known about the neural

mechanisms behind dissociation, and less is
clear on how dissociation may affect overall
executive functioning. The current
experiment explores dissociation’s effect on
neural responses to highly charged stimuli
and their relation to behavioral measures of
executive processes. In particular, the study
seeks to explore in what situations
dissociation may hold an advantage for an
individual and act adaptively. Using dense
array EEG to record neural responses,
researchers examined event-related
potentials (ERPs) in participants ranking high
or low on dissociation during a divided
attention emotional Stroop task. Distinct
between group differences were identified in
ERPs related to attention and meaning
processing, including medial frontal
negativity (MFN) and the P300, where high
dissociators presented with particularly
attenuated ERPs compared to low
dissociators. Despite presenting with
seemingly blunted neural responses, high
dissociators performed at a higher capacity
in several behavioral domains compared to
low dissociators. These results indicate that
high dissociators are employing an
alternative cognitive strategy, which is not
only effective in divided attention conditions
and responses to charged stimuli, but
potentially advantageous.

SEPARABLE COMPONENTS OF
SPONTANEOUS FOOD CUE REACTIVITY
PREDICT DIETERS’ SELF-CONTROL SUCCESS
IN DAILY LIFE Richard B. Lopez - Dartmouth
College; Pin-Hao A. Chen - Dartmouth
College; Todd F. Heatherton - Dartmouth
College – Previous neuroimaging work has
shown that increased reward related activity
following incidental food cue exposure
predicts self-control failure. However, there
has been little research probing spontaneous
activity in other brain systems that may be
recruited to support self-regulatory processes
when people encounter tempting cues. We
examined spontaneous recruitment of
executive control regions in chronic dieters, a
population that constantly faces self-control
dilemmas. We recruited 69 female dieters to
complete a food cue reactivity task during
an fMRI scanning session, which was then
followed by a weeklong sampling of daily
eating behaviors. Parameter estimates
representing food cue specific activity in a

36

!
priori regions of interest (ROIs) were
submitted to a principal components analysis
(PCA) in order to extract orthogonal
components that may reflect reward and
control processes. The PCA revealed a
control component (on which ROIs in dorsal
and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex loaded),
as well as two reward components (on which
ventral striatum and OFC ROIs loaded,
respectively). Next, we conducted a kmeans clustering based on factor scores for
these reward and control components and
found that our sample of dieters divided into
three clusters. The sub-group of dieters with
higher factor scores for the control
component and lower factor scores for the
reward component(s) reported the fewest
desire instances and were least likely to give
in to temptations to eat. This approach
identified those dieters who spontaneously
recruited regulatory regions in response to
incidental food cues. It also demonstrated a
novel way to compute brain-derived indices
of self-control capacity.

University; Arielle Baskin-Sommers - Yale
University; Kent Kiehl - University of New
Mexico; Joseph P. Newman - University of
Wisconsin-Madison; Joshua W. Buckholtz Harvard University, Massachusetts General
Hospital – Intertemporal decision-making
involves the generation and comparison of
subjective value representations for two
options that differ in both absolute value and
in time. Prior work indicates that striatum and
ventromedial prefrontal cortex support the
representation of subjective values during
cost-benefit decision-making, and suggests
that dysregulation within this corticostriatal
circuit predisposes maladaptive choice
behavior (impulsivity). Notably, this same
circuit is also involved in the expected value
representations during instrumental learning,
and in the updating of such values following
unexpected feedback. This suggests that
deficits in two distinct forms of value-based
decision-making (intertemporal choice and
feedback learning) may arise from a
common source: corticostriatal

dysregulation. To test this relationship, we
scanned 49 incarcerated offenders with a
mobile 1.5T MR device while they performed
an instrumental learning task. Impulsive
choice behavior was assessed by fitting
intertemporal choice data to a hyperbolic
discounting model. To assess the relationship
between impulsivity and reinforcement
learning, we regressed each participant’s k
value against BOLD estimates derived from
imaging models of expected value and
prediction error (a-priori anatomical ROIs:
striatum, midbrain, and ventromedial
prefrontal cortex). Impulsive participants had
stronger expected value signals within
VMPFC. Likewise, impulsivity was positively
associated with the magnitude of prediction
error signals within both the midbrain and
VMPFC. Together, these results indicate that
impulsive choice behavior is linked to hyperreactivity in mesocorticostriatal reward
circuitry during valuation of choices and
integration of feedback. This suggests that
corticostriatal circuit dysfunction may
comprise a common source for deficits in
multiple forms of value-based decisionmaking.

RISK TAKERS MAY ONLY HAVE PROBLEMS
WITH COGNITIVE CONTROL WHEN STIMULI
ARE MOTIVATIONALLY COMPELLING Feng
Xue - University of Southern California;
Benjamine Smith - University of Southern
California; Gui Xue - Beijing Normal University;
Stephen J. Read - University of Southern
California – Some neuroimaging studies
suggest that risk takers may have general
defects in cognitive and inhibitory control.
However, our recent findings in risky decisionmaking don’t support this view, instead
suggesting that these problems occur in
response to motivationally compelling stimuli.
We recruited 106 gay men who did a
modified GO/NOGO task while being
scanned in an fMRI scanner. In the
GO/NOGO task, we compared highly salient
stimuli: pictures of buff naked young men
with less salient stimuli: pictures of older, less
attractive clothed women. Participants
responded significantly less accurately to
pictures of naked men (both Go and Nogo
trials). They also responded significantly faster
on Go trials of naked men. We also found
their d’ value for male Nogo condition was
significantly lower than in the female Nogo
condition, suggesting that they have
difficulty inhibiting their responses to

37

!
motivationally compelling stimuli. In our
neuroimaging data, we measured the
difference between the (Nogo-Go) contrast
in the male condition with that in the female
condition. We found activation on the
(Nogo-Go) contrast was significantly stronger
in the anterior Cingulate cortex and the
bilateral lateral Occipital cortex in the male
condition. Together with the behavioral
results, it shows that those subjects have
more difficulty in dealing with motivationally
compelling stimuli even though they
recruited more cognitive resources. It
suggests that they may not have difficulty in
cognitive control generally but in resisting
risks that are motivationally compelling to
them.

Stephen J. Read - University of Southern
California – 113 gay men (Black, Hispanic,
and White, gay men aged 18-30) played a
computer dating game allowing them to
make decisions about condom use and
other sexually risky decisions during fMRI
imaging (fMRI but not behavioral data was
excluded for 7 additional subjects due to
data processing errors). We were interested
in the neural processes producing and
regulating risky sexual behavior. Subjects who
consistently made sexually safe choices in
the scanner reported less unprotected anal
intercourse in the previous 90 days in real life
(N=95, Mdn=2) compared to subjects who
made one or more sexually risky choices
during gameplay (N=25, Mdn=5), indicating
that computer game behavior was related
to real-life behavior. During risky sexual
decision-making, sexually riskier subjects, i.e.,
those who had unprotected anal intercourse
at least once in the previous 90 days (N=76),
had significantly more bilateral striatal and
dlPFC activity in a whole-brain cluster
analysis, controlling for baseline activity,
compared to sexually safer subjects who
reported never using methamphetamine
(N=31). No significant differences were found
between the subset of sexually riskier subjects
who used methamphetamine (N=34) and

those who had not (N=42). Mean decisionmaking time did not significantly differ
between groups. On this decision-making
task, not only do risky subjects experience
more rewarding affect which drives risky
decision-making; they also reflect more
consciously more on their decision. Ongoing
work examines the relationship between
meth use and risky sexual behavior and the
influence of internalized homophobia on risky
sexual decision-making.

PAVLOVIAN-TO-INSTRUMENTAL TRANSFER
OF CIGARETTE AND FOOD CUES DURING
ABSTINENCE IN SMOKERS Heena Manglani

- Rutgers University; Andrea H. Lewis - Rutgers
University; Stephen J. Wilson - The
Pennsylvania State University; Mauricio R.
Delgado - Rutgers University – Deprivation of
reinforcers such as nicotine and food can
elicit craving responses in smokers and
promote reward-seeking behavior. However,
it is unclear whether an abstinent state
dictates general reward-seeking, or has more
selective influence over behavior based on
the type of reinforcer. Using a Pavlovian-toinstrumental transfer (PIT) task, we tested
differences in reactivity to food and
cigarette cues within a single population of
smokers under 12 hours of abstinence from
both smoking and eating. In this PIT
paradigm, participants first associate distinct
conditioned stimuli (CS) with food, cigarette,
and neutral outcomes. They then learn
distinct instrumental responses (i.e., key
presses) that lead to each reward. Finally in
a subsequent transfer phase, we examine
the ability of CS to elicit learned instrumental
responses in the absence of the paired
outcomes. Results showed an increase in
vigorous responding during presentation of
each CS—an effect that was exacerbated
by smoking history. Interestingly, although
there was no difference in self-reported
craving for cigarettes and food, rewardseeking behavior to each CS differed.
Notably, only the presentation of the
cigarette CS elicited more accurate
responding (i.e., selective instrumental
response associated with that outcome).
These findings suggest that cues
representative of cigarette outcomes may
elicit more motivated discriminatory behavior
than cues related to other reinforcers (e.g.,
food), even when deprivation from nicotine
and food is similar. Understanding how
reward-seeking behavior is driven by current

38

!
state and by conditioned cues associated
with distinct reinforcers, may help with
improving smoking cessation treatments.

IMMEDIATE AND LASTING EFFECTS OF
HIGH REWARD PROSPECTS ON
COGNITIVE CONTROL Catherine Insel -

!

Harvard University; Catherine R. Glenn Harvard University; Erik K. Kastman - Harvard
University; Megan C. Garrad - Harvard
University; Stephanie F. Sasse - Harvard
University; Matthew Nock - Harvard University;
Leah H. Somerville - Harvard University – Prior
work suggests that reward incentives can
improve cognitive control. This effect is most
prominent when value contingencies are
signaled in advance, facilitating the
implementation of proactive cognitive
control. These reward incentive cues signal
information about prospective rewards and
the control demands required to obtain
them. Therefore, value associations that are
formed by reward/control cues may reflect
both motivational incentives and inhibitory
preparation. However, it remains unknown
whether these reward/control associations
undergo consolidation to form a sustained
motivated memory that would, in turn,
influence future control behavior. To
investigate this question, adolescent and
adult participants performed two response
inhibition tasks. The first was a novel
rewarded go/no-go task that included
intermixed low and high stakes conditions.
Participants viewed a cue indicating the
stakes of a block, either low or high, followed
by a series of target trials. Targets consisted
of go trials that required a button press, and
no-go trials that required withholding a
response. Accurate performance was
rewarded $1.00 or $0.20 per trial in the high
and low stakes conditions respectively,
whereas incorrect performance incurred a
loss of $0.50 or $0.10. Feedback was
displayed at the end of each block.
Participants next completed a second
go/no-go task that involved only the stakes
cues and no monetary payout. Participants
alternated between responding to only low
stakes cues and responding to only high
stakes cues. Results for the first task suggest
that high reward incentives led to improved
performance. There was a main effect of
reward stakes on reaction time, whereby go
responses were faster in the high stakes
condition compared to the low condition.
The effect of stakes on no-go performance

was not significant, suggesting that rewardrelated speeding did not result in a
speed/accuracy tradeoff. Results from the
second test demonstrated that participants
were better able to withhold responses to
high than low stakes cues. These findings
reveal that when cues are associated with
both reward and control information,
subsequent control ability increases for high
stakes associations. More broadly, these
findings suggest that control contingencies
are consolidated along with value
representations, lasting in sustained inhibition
tendencies.

RISK-TAKING, RESPONSE INHIBITION AND
THE RIGHT INFERIOR FRONTAL GYRUS Nils
Muhlert - Cardiff University; Fred Boy Swansea University; Andrew Lawrence Cardiff University – The ability to inhibit motor
responses has been linked to risk-taking
behavior, including gambling. This suggests
that those with high trait levels of sensation
seeking, the major personality determinant of
risk taking, may have poorer response
inhibition. We provide converging evidence
to support this: first by testing whether
performance on a stop-signal response
inhibition task relates to levels of sensation
seeking, and second, by assessing whether
variation in sensation seeking is associated
with grey matter volumes of a region
causally implicated in response inhibition, the
right inferior frontal gyrus (rIFG).
For study one, 87 healthy subjects (25 males)
completed a measure of sensation seeking
together with a stop-signal task. For study
two, 152 healthy subjects (45 males)
completed the sensation seeking measure
and underwent T1-weighted MRI at 3T. We
carried out a voxel-based morphometry
analysis using DARTEL to examine grey matter
volumes, with a region of interest centred on
the rIFG. UPPS Sensation Seeking, but not
other impulsivity facets, correlated with StopSignal task performance, with higher
sensation seeking associated with poorer
response inhibition. The DARTEL analysis
revealed significant negative associations
between sensation seeking and grey matter
volumes in the rIFG, the right orbitofrontal
cortex and right middle temporal gyrus.
We provide converging evidence to support
the link between risk taking and motor
inhibition, both at a psychological and at a
biological level. This may explain why
individuals with disinhibitory disorders sharing

39

!
genetic variation with sensation seeking
show poor response inhibition and suggests a
key role of the rIFG in self-control.

NEURAL MECHANISMS OF REWARD AND
SELF-REGULATION IN CONSENSUS
ESTIMATION AND SOCIAL INFLUENCE

Benjamin Locke Welborn - University of
California, Los Angeles; Matthew D.
Lieberman - University of California, Los
Angeles – Adapting to a complex and
dynamic social environment demands
effective regulation of the relationship
between our own attitudes and those of the
broader group or community. We must first
be able to accurately estimate group
consensus on important issues and then
overcome prepotent commitments in order
to harmonize our attitudes with those of
others. In order to better understand how
these complementary processes connect
our attitudes to those of the broader
community, we have investigated the neural
correlates of consensus estimation and social
influence in two fMRI studies.
In an fMRI investigation of the false consensus
effect (FCE; n=28), regions implicated in
social reward (including the NAcc and
VMPFC) demonstrated a positive relationship
with between-subjects differences in
consensus estimation bias. Conversely,
participants’ recruitment of right
ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (RVLPFC) was
associated with the ability to attenuate
consensus bias, so as to bring consensus
estimates in line with the group’s actual
attitudes. In a second fMRI study (n=19), we
explored the neural mechanisms supporting
social influence from peer attitudes.
Mentalizing regions, including the MPFC and
RTPJ, as well as regulatory regions (RVLPFC)
were positively associated with participants’
sensitivity to social influence. Taken together,
these results suggest that dynamic interplay
between social reward and self-regulation
shapes individuals’ vulnerabilities and
resistances to both social influence and the
FCE. It is our belief that future research can
further illuminate the neural processes that
allow us to interrogate our own attitudes, as
well as those of others, in ecologically valid
and motivationally charged circumstances.

WORKING HARDER TO SUCCEED:
INCREASED RELIANCE ON LATERAL PFC
ENGAGEMENT ACROSS EARLY
ADOLESCENCE PREDICTS LONGITUDINAL
INCREASES IN RISKY BEHAVIOR Ethan M.

McCormick - University of Illinois - Urbana
Champaign; Eva Telzer - University of Illinois Urbana Champaign – Successful cognitive
control is crucial for our everyday behavior;
allowing for the selection of contextappropriate actions and the suppression of
inappropriate responses. Cognitive control
has been shown to be a resource that can
be depleted (Muraven et al, 1998); as
individuals become accustomed to a
particular task, their performance becomes
more automatic and less reliant on effortful
control. This may be reflected by a
disengagement of the prefrontal cortices
over task-dependent skill acquisition. A key
region involved in cognitive control is the
ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC) (Aron
et al., 2004; Levy & Wagner, 2011).
Developmentally, the VLPFC is a latematuring brain region, which is thought to
contribute to the increased occurrence of
risk-taking behaviors during this period (Eshel
et al., 2007). However, relatively few studies
have looked at the development of
cognitive control across time in a longitudinal
design. We propose that changes in VLPFC
engagement across the early adolescent
years is an important marker in the
development of cognitive control and risktaking behavior. During an fMRI scan, 20
adolescents performed a go/no-go task at
the end of eighth grade and again at the
end of ninth grade, and reported on their
risk-taking behaviors at both time points.
Adolescents who showed an increase in risktaking over time also demonstrated less
bilateral VLPFC disengagement over time
during nogo trials where subjects were
successful in behaviorally inhibiting their
responses. This failure to disengage among
risky youths may reflect a greater need for
effortful VLPFC regulation of behavior.

Medicine at Mount Sinai – Substantial
research has indicated the effectiveness of
engaging reappraisal in order to reduce selfreported negative affect via recruitment of
prefrontal cortex and down-regulation of
amygdala activity in individual sessions.
However, there has been far less research
into whether reappraisal training can yield
adaptive changes in brain and behavior
over time, both in healthy populations and in
populations for whom emotion regulation
often fails. Borderline personality disorder
(BPD) is the prototypical disorder involving
emotion dysregulation. In this study, we
assessed whether BPD patients could be
trained to enhance reappraisal via
psychological distancing, which involves
viewing stimuli as an impartial, objective
observer. At each of five sessions, BPD and
healthy control (HC) participants were shown
negative social emotional images and given
instructions to reappraise their responses to
half and to look and respond naturally at the
other half. Negative emotion self-reports
were obtained after each image
presentation. Sessions 1-5 were spaced two
days apart and afforded training through
practice on novel images. fMRI data were
acquired at Sessions 1 and 5. We found that
BPD patients showed significantly reduced
negative emotion self-reports over time.
Further, with training, BPD patients increased
activity during reappraisal in ventrolateral
prefrontal cortex, a region engaged during
reappraisal in HC’s in this and prior studies.
BPD patients also showed longitudinal
attenuation of amygdala activity. These
data represent the first evidence that
longitudinal training can increase reappraisal
success and normalize reappraisal neural
activity in any patient population and
suggest a potential translational role for
reappraisal training in BPD treatment.

LINKING PROCESS AND OUTCOME: AGERELATED DIFFERENCES IN VISUAL

FIXATION AND PFC RECRUITMENT DURING
INSTRUCTED EMOTION REGULATION Eric
Allard - Cleveland State University; Elizabeth
Kensinger - Boston College – The age-related
positivity effect in emotional information
processing is assumed to be the
consequence of older adults’ emotion
regulation goal priorities. However, direct
evidence linking positivity effects and
emotion regulation goal processing (and
regulatory outcomes) is rather limited. The
present study examined younger and older
adults’ visual attention patterns toward
positive and negative film clips in response to
explicit emotion regulation instructions during
an fMRI scan session. Participants viewed
positive, negative, and neutral film clips in
three viewing conditions: passive viewing (no
regulation instruction), selective attention
(attentional deployment), and reappraisal.
We focused our analyses on discriminating
hedonic vs. non-hedonic gaze patterns in
relation to neural activation patterns during
the regulation conditions. Results revealed
that gaze was most associated with neural
activity for older adults in the reappraisal
condition. However, this effect was specific
to fixation patterns when amplifying hedonic
reactions to positive videos: longer fixation
times to positive videos (relative to negative
videos) in this condition were associated with
enhanced ventral ACC and OFC activity. For
younger adults, differential activity patterns
emerged for hedonic fixation preferences in
the selective attention condition: greater
OFC activity linked with fixation during
positive video viewing and greater VLPFC
activity linked with fixation during negative
video viewing. The present results help
expand upon notions of age-related
positivity effects in overt behavior (i.e., visual
fixation patterns) can be more specifically
linked to regulatory outcomes as evidenced
by age differences in neural recruitment
during explicit emotion regulation tasks. !

INTERACTIONS OF EMOTIONAL VALENCE
AND AGE IN EMOTIONAL REGULATION

Christopher R. Madan - Boston College; John
A. Morris - Boston College; Christina M.
Leclerc - State University of New York at
Oswego; Elizabeth A. Kensinger - Boston
College – Aging may affect one’s ability to
regulate emotions, and the mechanisms
used to do so. However, less is known about
how emotional valence interacts with age to

41

!
influence the recruitment of emotion
regulation networks. Here we investigated
emotion regulation of positively- and
negatively-valenced emotional images in
younger and older adults. Initially, we sought
to test for brain regions that were activated
to a greater degree when regulating positive
images than negative images, and vice
versa. Surprisingly, no regions demonstrated
either pattern in both populations (i.e., a
conjunction). However, in both groups, there
was disproportionate activity recruited during
the regulation of responses to positive
images compared to negative ones. In
young adults, positively-valenced regulation
evoked greater activation in a number of
regions, including the medial prefrontal and
orbitofrontal cortices, and the caudate,
when compared to negative regulation. In
older adults, positive regulation evoked
greater activations in the vlPFC, insula, and
hippocampus. These results emphasize the
importance of examining the processes that
subserve the regulation of positive as well as
negative emotion. They also emphasize that
the neural mechanisms of emotional
regulation varies with age – as it appears
that young and older adults recruited distinct
brain regions when regulating their emotions.

CULTURAL DIFFERENCES IN BELIEFS,
PRACTICES, AND NEURAL MECHANISMS
OF EMOTION REGULATION Yang Qu -

University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign; Eva
H. Telzer - University of Illinois, UrbanaChampaign – Culture shapes how individuals
engage in emotion regulation. Compared
with Western culture, East Asian culture
encourages individuals to modify their
feelings to maintain group harmony (Markus
& Kitayama, 1991). Moreover, East Asian
dialectical thinking is characterized by a
belief that reality is constantly changing,
such that misery can turn into happiness and
happiness can turn into misery (Peng &
Nisbett, 1999). Thus, we hypothesized that
East Asians would believe the ability to
regulate emotion is more changeable, use
reappraisal to change their emotion more
often, and recruit less neural resources when
regulating emotion. Using a modified fMRI
emotion regulation task (Ochsner et al.,
2004), 14 American and 15 Chinese
participants were instructed to use cognitive
reappraisal to decrease their negative
emotion. Participants also reported their
implicit theory of emotion regulation (Tamir et

al., 2007) and frequency of reappraisal
(Gross & John, 2003). Findings demonstrate
that Chinese participants self-reported more
frequent use of reappraisal, which was
mediated by their higher incremental theory
of emotion regulation. Chinese participants
showed lower VLPFC activation than
American participants when decreasing
negative emotions. This lower VLPFC
activation was associated with higher
incremental theory of emotion and more
frequent use of cognitive reappraisal.
Findings suggest that Chinese individuals'
cultural beliefs about emotion regulation
shapes their use of reappraisal in their daily
lives which is associated with less recruitment
of prefrontal regions when engaging in
cognitive regulation, which may underlie
their ability to engage in effective emotion
regulation and maintain group harmony.

WHEN GOOD BECOMES BAD: CULTURE
MODULATES COGNITIVE REAPPRAISAL OF
POSITIVE EMOTION Yang Qu - University of
Illinois, Urbana-Champaign; Eva H. Telzer University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign –
Western individualism places emphasis on
maximizing one’s positive emotion (Kitayama
et al., 2000). In contrast, such maximization is
not socially valued in East Asian collectivistic
culture. For example, Chinese parents deemphasize their children’s success by
pointing out mistakes (Ng et al., 2007).
Indeed, experimental evidence suggests that
Asians (vs. Americans) tend to dampen
positive emotion to a greater extent
(Miyamoto & Ma, 2011). However, the
mechanisms through which culture
modulates regulation of positive emotion
remain unclear. The current study used a
neuroimaging approach to move beyond
documenting cultural differences in
behavioral regulation of positive emotion
and examine mechanisms underlying such
cultural differences. Fourteen American and
15 Chinese participants completed a
modified fMRI emotion regulation task
(Ochsner et al., 2004), in which they were
instructed to either increase or decrease
their positive emotion by using cognitive
reappraisal. Following reappraisal,
participants rated how they felt (0=very
negative, 5=neutral, 9=very positive). While
American and Chinese participants reported
feeling similarly positive when up-regulating
positive emotion, Chinese participants
reported significantly less positive feelings

42

!
when down-regulating positive emotion,
suggesting that Chinese individuals are more
likely to bring down their positive emotions.
Whole brain analyses indicated that Chinese
participants showed greater prefrontal
cortex (PFC) activation and greater
amygdala-PFC coupling when downregulating (i.e., decreasing) positive emotion,
suggesting greater neural regulation. Such
heightened amygdala-PFC coupling
significantly mediated cultural differences in
the behavioral tendency to decrease
positive emotions. Our findings suggest that
Chinese individuals’ cultural emphasis on
dampening positive emotions is supported
by their ability to engage in neural
regulation.

EMOTION REGULATION IN THE MIDDLE
SCHOOL YEARS: PROBLEM BEHAVIORS OR
EMOTION DISORDERS Lysandra D. SinclaireHarding - University of Cambridge; David
Whitebread - University of Cambridge –
Sustained exposure to threatening
environments may alter the biological stress
response and produce deficits in a child’s
ability to effectively regulate their emotions
(Gunnar & Quevedo, 2007). Early established
patterns of emotion regulation (ER) may
appear maladaptive or disordered in
normative environments, (e.g. at school,
McCrory et al., 2010) and are not well
explained by laboratory studies. In particular,
under-controlled negative emotion is linked
to problematic externalizing behaviors, whilst
over-control is associated with greater
internalizing problems. What are the
physiological indices underpinning ER
behaviors that unfold across childhood and
how do these relate to the emotional and
behavioural responses typically on display in
school? 128 participants (aged 7-9) from five
different UK primary schools were observed
during two collaborative LEGO construction
tasks. Skin conductance data were
combined with observation data and
compared to self-reports of ER strategies and
teacher-reports of child emotional and
behavioral tendencies. We tested 1) whether
children with higher levels of physiological
reactivity demonstrate more maladaptive
response-focused strategies and 2) if
participants with low physiological reactivity
employ more adaptive ER strategies.
Preliminary results support both hypotheses.
Teacher-reported emotional problems are
correlated with skin conductance lability

(p<0.01). Prosocial behaviors are related to
lower physiological reactivity (p<0.05). These
findings will be discussed alongside
observational data, building on existing
understanding of the physiological factors at
play in ER whilst also shedding light on the
regulatory strategies that underpin emotion
and behavioral tendencies in the applied
school setting.

INCREASED MYSTICISM AFTER BRAIN

Grafman - Northwestern University – Mystical
experiences are subjectively believed
encounters with a supernatural or
supernormal world. Though widely reported
across human cultures and throughout
human history, the neuro-biological basis of
mysticism remains unclear. Here, we
examined the causal contribution of specific
brain regions to reported mystical
experience in a sample of participants from
the Vietnam Head Injury Study who suffered
penetrating traumatic brain injury (pTBI; N=
104) and matched controls (MC; N=30).
Participants were tested on the Mysticism
Scale, that includes statements such as “I
have had an experience that I knew to be
sacred,” measured on a 9-point Likert scale
(from - 4 = definitely not true to + 4 =
definitely true). Voxel-based lesion-symptom
mapping analysis revealed that higher scores
on the Mysticism scale were associated with
lesions within a right fronto-temporo-parietal
network. This network was composed of gray
matter structures including the right
orbitofrontal cortex, dorsolateral prefrontal
cortex, superior and inferior temporal cortex,
and inferior parietal cortex; as well as
underlying white matter tracts including the
superior, anterior, and posterior corona
radiata. After grouping our pTBI patients
according to their scores on the Mysticism
Scale, we found that patients with higher
scores had greater lesion overlap in the right
dlPFC; whereas patients with lower scores
had greater lesion overlap in the right inferior
and superior temporal cortex. These findings
identify a homeostatic role of different
components of the right fronto-temporoparietal network in mystical experience. In
particular, it appears that the dlPFC has a

College of Medicine – Cognitive reappraisal
and expressive suppression are major
emotion regulation strategies in adjusting to
daily life. We hypothesized that cognitive
reappraisal and expressive suppression
would be related to alpha band power in
brain regions. Fifty-nine subjects were
examined with the Emotion Regulation
Questionnaire, and their EEG band power
during eyes closed at rest was recorded on
the same day. Reappraisal was positively
correlated with alpha power of the frontal
region in entire group (males and females).
In males, reappraisal was negatively
correlated with beta power of left temporal
region. In females, reappraisal was positively
correlated with alpha power of frontal and
central regions, education years, and age.
However, the suppression score was not
correlated with any of the band powers. No
significant differences in alpha power and
delta power were observed in any of brain
regions between males and females. In beta
power, significant differences were observed
between males and females in central,
parietal, right temporal, and occipital
regions, and marginally significant
differences were observed in frontal and left
temporal regions. In theta power, significant
differences were observed between males
and females in occipital region, and
marginally significant differences were
observed in central and parietal regions.
These results indicate that the prefrontal
activity appearing in the alpha band power
is correlated with reappraisal but not

Charlotte – When recovering from a
traumatic event, deliberate rumination of the
emotional event promotes post-traumatic
growth (PTG). For PTG to occur, individuals
must also process and regulate the emotions
that they experience as a result of the
trauma. Previous research has postulated
that reappraisal is adaptive in response to
low but not high-intensity negative stimuli
(Sheppes et al., 2014). The goal of the
present study is to examine whether the
tendency to reappraise low or high-intensity
negative stimuli predicts deliberate
rumination in the context of PTG. Ninety-four
participants who experienced a traumatic
experience within the last 6 months
completed an emotion regulation choice
task, where they viewed negative pictures of
low, medium, and high intensity and chose
to either distract or reappraise in response to
each photo. Proportion of reappraisal was
calculated for each intensity level.
Participants also completed questionnaires
about their traumatic event and completed
the Event-Related Rumination Inventory
(ERRI) and Perceived Stress Scale (PSS).
Results reveled that as previously
documented, proportion of reappraisal
decreased as intensity increased.
Interestingly, hierarchical regression analyses
controlling for impact of the traumatic event,
expectedness of the event, and perceived
stress reveal that the proportion of
reappraisal during high intensity trials
significantly predicts deliberate rumination
(β=.21, p<.05). Findings of this study indicate
that a tendency to reappraise negative
stimuli during only high intensity trials is
predictive of deliberate rumination, which is
necessary for PTG to occur. These results
suggest that the tendency to reappraise
during high intensity emotions may be
adaptive for recovery from trauma.

REAPPRAISAL CHANGES THE QUALITATIVE
EXPERIENCE OF EMOTION Luke J. Chang -

Gianaros - University of Pittsburgh; Stephen B.

Wager - University of Colorado Boulder –
Successful regulation of emotions is important
for maintaining our mental and physical
health. Though many studies have reliably
demonstrated that strategies such as
reappraisal are effective in decreasing
negative affective states, the precise
mechanism of how this process unfolds
remains unclear. One popular account
argues that reappraisal directly attenuates
the affective experience by recruiting
executive control systems. Alternatively,
reappraisal may not directly decrease the
brain’s reactivity to negative stimuli, but
instead qualitatively changes the affective
experience. Here we develop a sensitive
and specific signature of negative affect
elicited via negative arousing images and
evaluate these competing hypotheses. We
find modest evidence that our negative
affect signature decreases when participants
are instructed to reappraise, accounting for
only about 1% of the change in ratings.
Instead, using multivariate moderation, we
find stronger evidence that the affect
signature is reconfigured when reappraising
compared to naturally reacting to negative
stimuli, evidenced by increased weights in
the dACC, and decreased weights in the
MPFC, left amygdala, and areas of the visual
cortex. In addition, we identify a multivariate
representation of reappraisal that can
discriminate between reappraisal and
reactive states with 97% accuracy in leaveone-subject out cross-validation.
Interestingly, this pattern appears to be
capturing a distinct process from emotion as
it is unable to predict affective ratings.
However, when combined into an ensemble
algorithm, these two patterns can accurately
predict participants’ ratings to individual
pictures. Together these results suggest that
reappraisal recruits distinct neural circuitry
from emotional reactivity and appears to
change the experience of emotion.

ADDRESSING THE EMOTION PARADOX:
OLDER ADULTS SHOW IMPAIRED
REGULATION BUT ENHANCED BOTTOM-UP
POSITIVE RESPONSE TO NEGATIVE STIMULI

Daisy Burr - Columbia University; Bruce Dore Columbia University; Chelsea Boccagno Columbia University; Jochen Weber Columbia University; Alexa Hubbard - New
York University; Stern Yaakov - Columbia
University; Kevin Ochsner - Columbia
University – Although many cognitive
faculties decline with age, research in
affective science suggests that positive
affect increases steadily across the lifespan,
a phenomenon referred to as the emotion
paradox. Reappraisal – a cognitive emotion
regulation strategy – entails reinterpreting
negative events in order to change
emotional responses and relies on control
regions that are known to decline with age.
While reappraisal is used across the lifespan,
there may be qualitative differences in the
way that older versus younger adults tend to
reappraise. The current study investigates
how older versus younger adults respond to
emotional images from behavioral and
neural perspectives. While undergoing an
fMRI scan, participants were asked to
respond to negative IAPS images in two
different ways: look (i.e., respond naturally) or
reappraise (specifically positive reappraisal),
and rate their positive and negative affect.
In line with previous research, older adults
show more positive affect when responding
naturally to negative images; our data
suggest that this effect is related to
recruitment of brain reward regions.
Moreover, older adults, relative to younger
adults, show decreased regulation success
and diminished recruitment of control regions
when positivizing. Taken together, these
findings are consistent with the notion that
older adults show impaired regulation yet
amplified bottom-up positive affect in
response to negative experiences.

Jochen Weber - Columbia University; Alexa
Hubbard - New York University; Stern Yaakov Columbia University; Kevin Ochsner Columbia University – The ability to
cognitively regulate emotional responses to
aversive events can enhance psychological
and physical well-being. Reappraisal, a
widely studied form of emotion regulation,

45

!
involves changing one’s thinking in order to
modify emotional responses. Although
reappraisal is used across the lifespan,
previous studies indicate there are
differences in the extent to which older and
younger adults successfully regulate their
emotions, as well as in the type of cognitive
regulation strategy older versus younger
adults use. Little is known, however, about
the neural and psychological mechanisms
underlying age-related differences in
reappraisal. This study investigates how older
versus younger adults experience and
respond to aversive images. While
undergoing an fMRI scan, participants were
instructed to respond to neutral and
negative IAPS images in one of two ways:
look (i.e., respond naturally) or reappraise
(specifically, minimize [i.e., dampen negative
feelings]). Following each image,
participants were asked to rate their affect.
Findings reveal that, when instructed to
minimize, older adults bilaterally recruit
ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (vlPFC)
regions, while younger adults unilaterally
recruit a region of left vlPFC. Moreover,
affect ratings suggest that older adults are
impaired at minimizing, suggesting
inefficiency in control region recruitment.
Findings from a post-scanner task, in which
participants were given the opportunity to
choose to look naturally at or reappraise
aversive IAPS images show that older adults,
relative to younger adults, choose to
reappraise rather than look. Taken together,
these findings suggest that older adults are
impaired in regulatory capacity, but more
motivated than younger adults to regulate.

The explosive rise of social media and
computer-mediated communication (CMC)
has transformed social-emotional

interactions, but few studies have explored
links between emerging communication
technology and emotional individual
differences. This study tested whether CMC
preferences were associated with scalprecorded event-related potentials (ERPs)
reflecting early emotional reactivity (the N1),
and motivated attention and sustained
emotional processing and modulation (the
late positive potential or LPP). EEG was
recorded while 22 participants completed
two computer-based tasks: a passive viewing
task of emotional and neutral pictures, and
an emotion regulation task with instructions
to increase, decrease or maintain their
emotional responses to pleasant and
unpleasant images. Participants reported
their satisfaction with their social support
networks and preferences for CMC versus
face-to-face interactions on three subscales:
positive social communication, expressing
distress, and casual communication. A CMC
preference (relative to face-to-face)
predicted increased N1 amplitudes to
pleasant and unpleasant images, suggesting
heightened emotional reactivity. In addition,
a CMC preference for casual
communication predicted decreased LPP
amplitudes when participants were asked to
increase responses to unpleasant stimuli,
suggesting dampened regulatory flexibility. A
CMC preference also was associated with
decreased satisfaction with social support
networks and reduced number of people
available for support. Taken together, these
findings suggest that individuals showing
heightened emotional reactivity and
inhibited range of responses to unpleasant
stimuli (dampened up-regulation) may prefer
CMC over face-to-face interactions for
social-emotional communications –
particularly in the context of weakened
social support. Implications and future
directions are discussed, including a model
of the emotion regulatory functions of CMC.

University of Lübeck; Oliver Tüscher University Medical Centre Mainz; Rainer
Goebel - Maastricht University; Arnoud Arntz Maastricht University – Leading theories on
the etiology of borderline personality disorder
(BPD) propose that BPD is best understood as
an emotion dysregulation disorder, caused
by an increased emotional sensitivity and an
inability to regulate emotional responses. In
response to emotional stimuli fMRI studies in
BPD highlight a failure of the inhibitory effect
of cognitive top-down control modulated by
the regulatory prefrontal areas on the
hyperreactive bottom-up limbic emotion
generation areas. However, there are two
important issues that should be addressed
when trying to understand BPD-pathology.
Firstly, the generalizability of emotional
sensitivity and emotion regulation difficulties
across different stimulus categories.
Secondly, the specificity of BPD emotional
sensitivity and emotion regulation compared
to other personality disorders. For this
purpose, 56 BPD patients, 38 non-patients
and 25 cluster-c personality disorder patients
from four different international institutes
performed an emotion regulation task during
fMRI. Differences in brain activity were
compared between groups in response to
two conditions: ‘passive view’ and ‘realizing
to be safe’. A region-of-interest approach
was used based on the model of cognitive
control of emotion as proposed by Ochsner,
Silvers and Buhle (2012). Additionally the
hippocampus was added. We hypothesized
that BPD patients, compared to both control
groups, showed an increased activity in
emotion generation brain areas during
passive viewing, especially for the negative
and erotic stimuli. Additionally, we expected
tlelehat BPD patients would show decreased
activity in the emotion regulation brain areas
during down-regulation to emotional stimuli
along with failure to modulate the limbic
areas. Results will be discussed.

negative bias are two core features of major

have found that individuals with MDD show
blunted reward learning, but no study has
probed punishment learning in unmedicated
MDD. The goal of the study is to understand
neural mechanisms associated with learning
deficits in MDD. We acquired fMRI data from
unmedicated 24 MDD and 23 healthy
controls during a reinforcement learning task,
during which a pair of stimuli was randomly
presented and participants had to choose
one of the stimuli. The 3 stimulus pairs (gain,
loss or neutral) were associated with 80%–
20% of feedback ($10/nothing, -$10/nothing,
0$/nothing respectively). To win money the
subjects had to learn, by trial and error, the
stimulus–outcome associations. Reward and
punishment prediction error signals using
temporal-difference algorithms were
calculated and parametrically modulated
with hemodynamic responses. Relative to
controls, MDD individuals had reduced
reward accuracy (p<0.05), but no
differences in punishment accuracy were
observed. A significant Group x Valence
interaction was observed in the left putamen
(-26,2,10, Z=4.34, 8mm radius small volume
correction applied at FDR p<0.05). Post-hoc
t-tests revealed that the MDD group had
decreased reward, but increased learning
signals in the putamen. In addition, both
reward (trend level) and punishment (p<0.05)
signals correlated with anhedonia score.
Specifically, higher anhedonic individuals
exhibited blunted reward and enhanced
punishment learning signals in the putamen.
These results show that MDD is characterized
by abnormal reward and punishment
learning, highlighting an important role of
anhedonia and negative bias in MDD.

Medical Sciences; Fateme Pirsalami –
Background: Schizophrenia is one of the
chronic and debilitating psychotic mental
disorder in more than 1% of population in all
over the world. The dopamine hypothesis
proposes that a dysfunction in dopamine
neurotransmission is the cause of the positive

47

!
symptoms of schizophrenia. Also a
glutamatergic deficiency such as decreased
glutamate release and a loss of GABA
neurotransmission activity has been reported
in schizophrenic brains. In this study,
stereotypic behaviors of mice were assessed
using Apomorphine and Strychnine as a
dopamine agonist and a GABA antagonist,
respectively. Materials and methods: In this
experimental study, 27 male albino mice
weighing 25-30g were collected randomly
and divided in 3 groups. Strychnine
(0.1mg⁄ml) and Apomorhine (5mg⁄ml) were
injected singly and intraperitoneally(IP). Time
out for injections was 15 minutes. As soon as
possible stereotypic behaviors such as
climbing, grooming and sniffing were
recorded. Effects of antipsychotic drugs
were assessed. Results: The results showed
that separated injection of Apomprhine and
Strychnine, induced stereotypic behaviors
such as climbing and grooming (p<0.05).
Coinjection of Apomorphine (5mg⁄kg) with
Strychnine (0.1mg⁄kg), caused significant
increase in climbing and grooming behaviors
(p<0.05). Consumption of Haloperidol and
Clozapine stopped stereotypic behaviors
induced by coinjection of Strychnine and
Apomorphine. Conclusion: Remarkable result
of this study is the role of Strychnine as a
GABA antagonist on increasing stereotypic
behaviors in mice similar to that of
Apomorphine. It is not clear if climbing
induced by Strychnine may serve as an
animal model of psychosis based on the
manipulation of GABAergic system.

Current diagnostic criteria often fail to
differentiate bipolar disorder from unipolar
depression. Therefore, this study aimed to
identify biomarkers that predict (hypo)mania
in a transdiagnostic sample of individuals
seeking treatment for mood disorders,

focusing on the domain of Reward Learning
within the RDoC Positive Valence Systems
matrix. We evaluated predictors of
(hypo)mania across three units of analysis.
First, behavioral reward learning was
assessed during a probabilistic reward task
(PRT). Second, feedback-related positivity
(FRP) and P300 amplitude to reward
feedback during the PRT were used to index
reward prediction-error-related, and
salience-related neural activity. Third,
glutamate within the rostral anterior
cingulate cortex (rACC) was quantified using
magnetic resonance spectroscopy. To date,
19 depressed subjects (5 with prior
hypomania), and 6 controls have been
recruited. Within the clinical sample,
depression severity was associated with
reduced behavioral reward learning in the
PRT. Within the whole sample, depression
severity (r=-.44, p=.03), particularly severity of
anhedonia (r=-.54, p=.006) was associated
with blunted FRP amplitude to reward
feedback in the PRT. In contrast, severity of
(hypo)mania was associated with increased
P300 amplitude to reward feedback (r=.48,
p=.02), as well as increased rACC glutamate
(r=.68, p=.046). These preliminary findings
indicate that depression was associated with
reduced behavioral reward learning and
blunted FRP (putatively indexing reduced
dopaminergic firing). In contrast,
(hypo)mania was associated with neural
responses indicative of heightened reward
salience, and increased levels of the brain’s
primary excitatory neurotransmitter. These
markers may provide a means of identifying
risk for bipolarity in individuals seeking
treatment for mood disorders.

BREAKING BAD: RAPIDLY DISENGAGING
FROM HAPPY CONTENT IN WORKING
MEMORY PREDICTS FUTURE DEPRESSION
SYMPTOMS Tabitha N. Alverio - University of

North Carolina at Charlotte; Sara M. Levens University of North Carolina at Charlotte –
There are many different reasons why
individuals develop depression—the loss of a
loved one, experiencing a trauma, etc. Yet
why some individuals suffer depression and
others are resilient is unclear. Individual
differences in how a person processes
emotion content and monitors emotional
content with executive processes may
provide insight into the development of
depression symptomatology. The goal of the

48

!
present study is to investigate whether biases
in the way a person updates emotional
content in working memory (WM) may
underlie the development of depression
symptoms. 160 participants completed two
experimental sessions: In session one (T1)
participants completed a series of
questionnaires assessing depression, stress
and affect, and the Emotion N-back task. To
perform the Emotion N-back task
participants viewed a series of facial
expressions (happy, sad, neutral, angry, and
fear) and indicated whether the currently
presented emotional expression was the
same (match-set) or different (break-set or
no-set) as the emotional expression
presented two faces earlier. In the second
session (T2; approximately four months later)
follow-up depression, stress and affect were
assessed. Emotion N-back task performance
was analyzed to elucidate whether
engaging and disengaging from emotional
content in the task predicts later levels of
depression. Results reveal that time to
disengage from positive content in WM
predicts later depression symptoms. These
findings suggest that assessments of
individual differences in emotion processing
and executive function may be predictive of
depression symptomology. Furthermore,
difficulty keeping positive information active
in WM may be a risk factor for depression.

CORTEX INVOLVEMENT IN REWARD
RELATED ENHANCEMENT OF VISUAL
PROCESSING Meffert Harma - National

Institute of Mental Health; Michelle
Vantieghem - Columbia University; James R.
Blair - National Institute of Mental Health –
The goal of this study was to determine the
neural circuitry that biases sensory processing
as a function of reward history. A recent
electroencephalography study suggested
that the anterior cingulate cortex plays a
crucial role in translating reward information
to regions involved in sensory processing
(Hickey et al., 2010a). Alternatively, or
additionally, the anterior insula might play
such a role by marking salient events for
additional processing (cf. Menon and Uddin,
2010). To investigate the neural circuitry
involved in reward related biasing of sensory
processing, we adapted the Additional
Singleton Task of Hickey et al. (2010a) for
fMRI. In this task, reward magnitude is

randomly determined after participants
correctly identify a target shape amongst an
array of distractor shapes. Importantly, our
results supported those of Hickey et al.
(2010a) by showing reward-related
modulation of activity within both visual
cortex and a rostral region of anterior
cingulate cortex. Moreover, they extended
these earlier findings by indicating important
roles for both anterior insula cortex and
caudate. Specifically, we suggest that these
data reflect reward related biasing of
sensory processing that is mediated by an
integrated effort of anterior insula and
anterior cingulate cortex on the basis of
value information received from the
caudate.

SEEING ONESELF ACTIVATES VALUATION
REGIONS FOR NARCISSISTS (AND THE REST
OF US) Noam Zerubavel - Columbia
University; Kevin Ochsner - Columbia
University – Narcissism is characterized by
inordinate interest in or admiration for
oneself, especially one’s own image. Here
we present the first neuroimaging research to
examine patterns of brain activity evoked by
one’s own image as a function of narcissism.
Specifically, we tested the hypothesis that
individual differences in subclinical narcissism
would correlate with activity in core
valuation regions—ventromedial prefrontal
cortex (vmPFC), ventral striatum (VS), and
amygdala—evoked by images of oneself
(relative to images of group members). To
do so, we recruited well-acquainted
members of student organizations and
photographed their faces. Participants
viewed their own and group members’ faces
while performing a simple cover task in the
scanner. In addition, they completed the
monetary incentive delay (MID) task as an
independent functional localizer to identify
regions of interest (ROIs) active during
anticipation and receipt of monetary
rewards: vmPFC, VS, and amygdala. We
found that parameter estimates extracted
from each of these ROIs were greater when
viewing one’s own face relative to the faces
of group members. Importantly, we found
that this effect was moderated by scores on
the Narcissistic Personality Inventory – 16 (NPI16) for each of the ROIs. These effects
remained significant even after accounting
for various potential confounds (e.g., facial
trustworthiness and attractiveness). More
broadly, the naturalistic paradigm we

advance here can be widely applied to

tobacco, and alcohol in the media
influences eating, drinking, and smoking
behavior in adolescents and young adults
(Heatherton & Sargent, 2009; McClure et al.,
2013; O’Hara et al., 2013). Neuroimaging
research has demonstrated that viewing
appetitive cues, like food or cigarettes,
consistently activates putative reward
regions (e.g., ventral striatum and
orbitofrontal cortex [OFC]), and the
magnitude of activations in these regions
can be used to predict real-world behavior
(e.g., giving in to desire [Lopez et al., 2014]
and weight gain [Demos et al., 2012]). Here
we examine whether alcohol advertisements
engage the reward system, and whether
activations predict self-reported drinking
behavior. 57 participants underwent fMRI
scanning while viewing images of fast food,
alcohol, car, and technology
advertisements. They then completed
surveys concerning their drinking behavior
and brand preferences. Results indicated
that a region of the OFC showed greater
activity when viewing alcohol ad images.
Moreover, the magnitude of the activation
predicted real-world drinking behaviors
reported by the participants, including
drinking frequency and binge drinking.
These results are consistent with our prior work
demonstrating a relationship between
reward activity and eating behavior and
suggest a domain general role for reward
regions in motivating appetitive behavior.

Northeastern University – Neuroscience
investigations of pleasant experience
typically focus on the reward circuitry that
has been studied extensively in non-human
animals. Human experiences of the “simple
pleasures in life,” though, often differ from
behaviorally oriented reward tasks. In an fMRI
study, we examined two forms of pleasant
experience: visual aesthetics and
conceptual amusement. We made use of
the simple visual and novel conceptual
features of “droodle” designs, which are
meaningless visual designs that only become
interpretable (and often amusing) when a
caption is supplied. Aesthetic color versions
of the designs were initially presented without
captions to evoke pleasant sensory
experiences, and then verbal captions were
presented with the same designs (classic
“droodles”) to evoke pleasant conceptual
experiences. Participants rated the feeling
evoked by each design after viewing each
block of images. While viewing the color
designs and while viewing the conceptual
designs, activity in subcortical regions
involved in reward processing (e.g., ventral
putamen) increased as the intensity of
participants’ pleasant feelings increased.
Activity in key regions of the salience network
(e.g., amygdala, anterior insula) also
correlated with subjective pleasantness
ratings, with color pleasantness associated
with more dorsal activity, and with
conceptual pleasantness associated with
more ventral activity. Consistent with this
dorsal-ventral gradient, fronto-parietal
regions involved in attention were associated
with color pleasantness whereas “default”
network regions involved in social inference
were associated with conceptual
pleasantness. Our results suggest that it is
important to understand how a variety of
pleasant experiences are constructed via
distributed patterns in the brain.

PARSING AFFECTIVE AND INFORMATIVE
REWARD PROPERTIES IN THE STRIATUM: A
HIGH-RESOLUTION FMRI INVESTIGATION

Kainan (Sally) Wang - Rutgers University;
David V. Smith - Rutgers University; Mauricio
R. Delgado – Rutgers University – Reward
processing plays a major role in shaping our
behavior. At the center of this pathway lies
the striatum. Understanding the contribution
of the striatum to reward processing has
been difficult because rewards themselves
consist of different properties. For example,

50

!
affective properties modulate emotional
experience while informative properties
signal how to adapt behavior to maximize
future gains. Yet, many neuroimaging studies
have been unable to parse reward
properties because of paradigmatic
constraints and poor spatial resolution. We
approached this problem using highresolution fMRI (1.8 mm3) combined with a
paradigm stressing affective and informative
reward properties through two distinct tasks.
In one task emphasizing affective properties,
subjects are instructed to pick from three
decks of cards to build up their point bank to
be eligible to play for money in the final
bonus game. In the other task emphasizing
informative properties, subjects are instructed
to learn the makeup of three decks of cards
so as to use that information to succeed in
the bonus game. We found that subjects
explored the decks more often in the pursuit
of information, irrespective of the magnitude
of information. We also found that both
reward properties evoke activation within the
striatum, with affective properties extending
ventrally and informative properties
extending dorsally. These results suggest that
rewards can be broken down into specific
properties that can be mapped onto the
striatum. Elucidating how affective and
informative reward properties are encoded
by the striatum may provide new insights into
the links between reward-processing circuitry
and behavior.

SOCIAL VALUE MODULATES STRIATAL
PREDICTION ERROR SIGNALING Katherine

E. Powers - Harvard University, Dartmouth
College; Leah H. Somerville - Harvard
University; William M. Kelley - Dartmouth
College; Todd F. Heatherton - Dartmouth
College – An important feature of adaptive
social behavior is the ability to flexibly modify
future actions based on the successes or
failures of past experiences. The ventral
striatum (VS) occupies a central role in this
shaping of behavior through feedbackbased learning signals called prediction
errors. Here, we examined how this striatal
response varies as a function of the value
associated with different social contexts.
Across two studies, participants (N = 52)
underwent fMRI scanning while answering
multiple-choice questions testing their
knowledge about the behaviors and
preferences of social groups associated with

high (in-group) and low (out-group) social
value. Participants were presented with
feedback indicating whether their responses
were correct or incorrect on a trial-by-trial
basis. Social group membership determined
the strength of the prediction error signal in
the VS, such that incorrect judgments about
in-group relative to out-group members
produced a greater striatal deactivation.
This dissociation provides evidence that the
VS is sensitive to variations in social value and
may help sustain in-group relationships by
signaling situations that are most in need of
social adjustment. Moreover, individuals high
in the need to belong showed greater striatal
responsivity for incorrect judgments
concerning in-group members. These results
are suggestive of a neural system highly
attuned to social context that functions to
advantageously support social relations by
translating the value of social cues into
motivated action.

OBSERVATION BY OTHERS FACILITATES
ETHICAL CONSUMER DECISION THROUGH
INTUITIVE VALUATION SYSTEM Daehyun

Jung - Korea University; Sunhae Sul - Korea
University; Minwoo Lee - Korea University;
Hackjin Kim - Korea University – Despite the
well-known evidence that prosocial behavior
can be facilitated by various cues of
observation by others, the exact neural
mechanism causing this phenomenon is
currently not known. The present fMRI study
investigated ethical consumer decisions with
or without observation by others. Participants
were randomly assigned to either control or
observation group and made purchasing
decisions for social or non-social products in
the scanner. Participants in the observation
group were told that their decisions would be
watched and recorded by others outside the
scanner. Behavioral results showed that the
observation group, compared to the control
group, showed higher purchase rate for
social than non-social products. fMRI results
showed that trial-by-trial decision biases
toward ethical consumption were predicted
by the caudate activity and social products
elicited stronger bilateral amygdala
activation than non-social products in both
groups. Interestingly, only the observation
group showed such differential activation
within the bed nucleus of stria terminalis
(BNST), a structure known to respond to
threat. Moreover, the BNST showed stronger
functional coupling with dorsal amygdala

51

!
during social vs. non-social product trials in
the observation group. Finally, a direct group
comparison revealed that the observation
group, compared to the control group,
showed increased activity in ventromedial
prefrontal cortex (VMPFC) and decreased
activity in dorsomedial prefrontal cortex
(DMPFC). Taken together, our findings
suggest that an increase in prosocial
decision with observation by others may be
subserved by the intuitive valuation system
involving VMPFC working with caudate,
amygdala, and BNST, which can be
interrupted/regulated by DMPFC without
observation.

were significantly negatively correlated with
hippocampal volume in the whole sample
(r(43)=-.39, p=.01) and retained trend
significance within trauma and PTSD subjects
(r(30)=-.31, p=.09). CAPS scores were not
significantly associated with hippocampal
volume. Reduced hippocampal volume may
be specifically associated with anhedonia
symptoms in posttraumatic spectrum adults.
This finding demonstrates the need for further
research exploring the role of the
hippocampus in reward processing in
trauma-related psychiatric illness.

ANHEDONIA IS ASSOCIATED WITH
REDUCED HIPPOCAMPAL VOLUME IN

Hospital; Isabelle M. Rosso - McLean Hospital
– Anhedonia is a clinical feature of numerous
psychiatric disorders, including posttraumatic
stress disorder (PTSD). It is defined as a
relative inability to experience pleasure from
rewarding activities and stimuli and has been
associated with abnormalities of the
mesolimbic dopamine reward pathway,
which is controlled in part by the
hippocampus. In animal models, repeated or
chronic stress induces both anhedonia and
neuronal atrophy in the hippocampus.
However, imaging studies of trauma-related
disorders have not investigated
hippocampal morphology as a possible
neural correlate of anhedonia. We
hypothesized a relationship between
hippocampal volume and Snaith-Hamilton
Pleasure Scale (SHAPS) scores in a sample of
nontraumatized and trauma-exposed adults
with varying degrees of PTSD symptoms. This
preliminary analysis includes twenty-two righthanded adults with PTSD, nine traumaexposed subthreshold PTSD subjects, and
thirteen healthy subjects. Subjects were
interviewed using the Structured Clinical
Interview for DSM-IV and underwent 3T
magnetic resonance imaging. PTSD
diagnoses were made using the ClinicianAdministered PTSD Scale (CAPS) and
anhedonia was assessed using the SHAPS.
Hippocampal volumes were corrected for
intracranial volume, and correlation analyses
examined SHAPS total scores relative to

Academy of Sciences; Xun Liu - Chinese
Academy of Sciences – Abstract
Objective: Recent studies have linked
internet addiction with a dysfunctional neural
reward system. Although some studies have
explored reward processing in healthy
individuals, no electrophysiological study has
been done in adolescents with internet
addiction disorder (IAD). The present study
aimed to examine reward processing in IAD
adolescents with event-related potentials.
Methods: Thirty-two IAD adolescents were
recruited from Internet Addiction Centre,
General Hospital of Beijing Military Region
and thirty-two matched healthy adolescents
were selected as controls. One IAD
adolescent was excluded for insufficient trials
to form ERPs. Behavioral scores were
compared across groups. Feedback-related
negativity (FRN) and positivity (P300) derived
from a simple gambling task were also
analyzed. Results: Behavioral data showed
that IAD adolescents were more willing to
make high-risk decisions than controls (54.55
% vs. 46.74%). ERP results showed that FRN
was reduced significantly for IAD adolescents
compared with controls, which was mainly
driven by a more negative FRN to gain
feedback. While the amplitude differences
of P300 were not prominent between IAD
adolescents and controls. Conclusions:
Adopting a simple gambling task, the
present study investigated the
electrophysiological correlates of reward
processing in IAD adolescents for the first
time. Behaviorally, IAD adolescents relative
to controls were more willing to take high-risk
decisions. More importantly, relative to
controls, they exhibited blunted responses at

52

!
the outcome appraisal stage, as index by
FRN, to gain outcomes, but not to loss
outcomes. Thus, our findings suggest that
internet addition among adolescents is
possibly driven by their reduced responses to
positive reward.

DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT OF MOUSE
PARADIGM OF DRUG SELFADMINISTRATION: A NOVEL MODIFIED
RUNWAY MODEL Pandi Vijayapandi -

University of Malaya; Yasmin Khan - University
of Malaya – Behavioral scientists have
employed operant runways as a means of
investigating the motivational impact of
incentive stimuli for the better part of the
past 100 years. The current study in our
laboratory for a first time demonstrated the
modified version of operant runway model of
drug self-administration in mice. This body of
work suggests that the modified runway
method serves as a powerful behavioral tool
for the study of the behavioral and
neurobiological basis of drug selfadministration. In this task, the speed with
which a trained animal travels a long straight
alley in zigzag manner for positive incentive
stimuli, like food or water, and drug of abuse
provides a reliable index of the subject's
motivation to seek those stimuli. The modified
runway paradigm is therefore a particularly
appropriate tool for investigating the drugseeking behavior of animals working for
drugs of abuse.

HOLD ON TO THE POSITIVE: THE ROLE OF
UPDATING EMOTIONAL CONTENT IN
INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES Sara M. Levens -

University of North Carolina at Charlotte –
Individual differences in emotion processing
have been linked to a host of psychological
and behavioral constructs. Importantly, the
application of cognitive resources to the
processing of an emotional stimulus is
governed by executive functions. Therefore
individual differences in how emotion and
executive functions interact may be central
to individual differences in behavior and
personality. Updating is an executive
function necessary for flexibly responding to
stimuli encountered in the environment or
recalled from memory. I present a series of
studies using an emotion n-back task that
examine how emotional content is updated
as well as the role of emotion updating in

individual differences. Results reveal that
updating emotional content differs as a
function of experience; individuals with
recent trauma are impaired, whereas
individuals with distant trauma update
emotional content significantly faster than
individuals with no trauma history.
Additionally results reveal interesting findings
with regard to updating positive content:
One, depressed and recovered depression
participants disengage from positive
information faster than never-depressed
controls. Two, time to disengage from
positive content predicts future depression
symptoms, with rapid disengagement of
positive content predicting higher levels of
depression symptomatology. And three,
time to disengage from positive content
differs as a function of attachment style, with
insecurely attached individuals disengaging
from happy content faster than securely
attached individuals. In sum, updating
emotional content differs as a function of
experience. Additionally, individual
differences in updating emotional content
reflect both maladaptive and protective
biases that may underlie affect regulation
and core aspects of personality and
behavior.

IS THERE NEURAL SPECIFICITY FOR BODILY
EMOTIONS? Isaiah Sypher - National Institute

of Mental Health; Harma Meffert - National
Institute of Mental Health; Roberta Clanton University of Birmingham; James Blair National Institute of Mental Health – There is
emerging data that suggest the involvement
of a core neural system in empathy for bodily
expressed emotions, including bilateral
anterior insula and dorsal anterior cingulate
cortex (Fan, Duncan, de Greck, & Northoff,
2011; Lamm & Singer, 2010). However, these
studies have been heavily focused on pain,
which may have biased the results (e.g.
Morelli, Rameson, & Lieberman, 2012). To
address this issue, participants viewed loving,
rejecting, painful and neutral hand
interactions while they were feeling the
emotion of one of the hands or attending to
the gender of one of the hands. The data
suggest that brain regions such as ventral
medial prefrontal cortex, dorsal medial
prefrontal cortex and anterior insula exhibit a
preference for one of the three emotions
used in the current design. In addition, the
data indicate the presence of a large
network of brain regions recruited while

53

viewing hand interactions, regardless of
emotional category, including bilateral
amygdala, premotor and somatosensory
regions and visual cortex.

NEURAL BASIS OF VARIABILITY IN

Verduyn - University of Leuven; Pauline
Delaveau - University Paris 06; Jean-Yves
Rotgé - University Paris 06; Peter Kuppens University of Leuven; Iven Van Mechelen University of Leuven; Philippe Fossati University Paris 06 – Emotions are processes
that unfold over time. Consequently, a full
understanding of emotions and emotion
characteristics can only be reached when
their dynamic nature is taken into account. A
particularly salient and dynamic
characteristic of emotions is their intensity.
During an emotional episode intensity varies
over time, resulting in an emotion intensity
profile. These profiles can take many different
shapes. Using dimension reduction and
clustering methods, it has been shown that
these profiles mainly differ in explosiveness
(i.e., some emotions have an explosive start
whereas others do not) and accumulation
(i.e., some emotions become stronger over
time whereas others do not). A number of
psychological determinants of explosiveness
and accumulation have already been
identified. In contrast, the neural basis of
these dynamic processes remains unknown.
In the present talk we will present an fMRI
study (N=31) aimed at discovering the neural
basis of emotion explosiveness and
accumulation. Following an emotion
induction using negative social feedback,
participants were asked to report on the
temporal unfolding of their emotional
response. Using non-negative matrix
factorization, we replicated the finding that
emotion intensity profiles mainly differ in
degree of explosiveness and accumulation.
Moreover, emotion explosiveness and
accumulation were found to have a
different neural signature with the insula
being negatively associated with
explosiveness and positively associated with
accumulation.

NEURAL FEATURES OF EMOTIONAL
LABILITY Randi H. Bennett - Fordham

University; Aleta Angelosante - New York

University Child Study Center; Rachel G. Klein
- New York University Child Study Center;
Amy K. Roy - Fordham University – Emotion
dysregulation in children is typically
characterized by frequent temper outbursts,
low frustration tolerance, and chronic
irritability. While this symptom is commonly
observed in internalizing disorders (e.g.
depression), it has also been associated with
externalizing disorders such as ADHD
(Stringaris & Goodman, 2009). Specifically,
although diagnostic criteria for ADHD are
focused on inattention and hyperactivity,
significant emotional lability (EL) is also often
present (Faraone et al., 1998). Neurally,
previous work has shown disruptions in
subcortical connectivity in relation to EL in
children with ADHD (Hulvershorn et al., 2014;
Posner et al., 2014). However, much of the
literature supports frontal involvement in
emotion regulation (Ochsner & Gross, 2005).
In fact, Arnsten and colleagues (2009)
posited that deficits in frontal connectivity
account for the range of behavioral,
cognitive, and emotional symptoms in ADHD.
The present study included three groups of
children (18 with EL, 16 ADHD controls without
EL, and 14 TD controls) and used resting-state
fMRI to examine intrinsic functional
connectivity of prefrontal circuits. Using a
medial PFC seed-based ROI analysis (Kelly et
al., 2009), we found that children who
exhibited severe EL had significantly
decreased mPFC-precuneus (p<0.01) and
significantly increased mPFC-postcentral
gyrus (p<0.01) functional connectivity in
comparison to ADHD and TD controls. This
decreased mPFC-precuneus connectivity is
in line with previous findings (Franzen et al.,
2013, Castellanos et al., 2008) and suggests
that typically posited disruptions in default
mode network connectivity in ADHD (Uddin
et al., 2008) may relate more specifically to
EL than to symptoms of ADHD.

INTEROCEPTIVE AWARENESS AND

Graduate School of Education; Xiaofei Yang

Hobeika - Ecole Normale Supérieure; Mary
Helen Immordino-Yang - University of
Southern California – According to classic
theories of emotion, the sense of the body’s
physiological state (interoception) forms a
basis of emotional experience. Across
different tasks of interoceptive awareness

54

!
(IA), East Asians have been found to be less
viscerally perceptive than European
Americans, and this trait has been
associated with acculturated styles of
cognitive processing. This study examined
whether cultural effects on IA emerge by
adolescence and whether differences in
bicultural adolescents’ (aged 14-16) degree
of acculturation is related to IA. East Asian
American and Latino American bicultural
adolescents’ performance on a heartbeat
detection task of IA was correlated with
acculturation as measured by the General
Ethnicity Questionnaire (GEQ). We separately
analyzed questionnaire items measuring
ethnic attitudes and ethnic behaviors. The
groups did not differ on IA. However, among
East Asian American adolescents, stronger
identification with Asian attitudes, but not
behaviors, was significantly correlated with
lower IA. No effect of acculturation on IA
was detected among Latino American
adolescents. An interpretation of this result is
that Asian Americans who are more sensitive
to visceral sensations may build their cultural
identity to align more closely with the
American cultural emphasis on “gut
feelings,” while Asian Americans with lower IA
may be predisposed toward other means of
constructing emotion. Latino Americans may
show no effect because both American and
Latin American cultures value attentiveness
to gut feelings. Overall, the results suggest a
potential interplay between biological
predispositions toward IA and cultural identity
development among bicultural East Asian
Americans.

AGING LEADS TO WEAKENED
RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SUBJECTIVE
EXPERIENCE OF AROUSAL AND SKIN
CONDUCTANCE RESPONSES Chenjie Xia -

Harvard University; Erika Siegel - Northeastern
University; Karen Quigley - Northeastern
University; Lisa Feldman Barrett - Harvard
University, Northeastern University; Bradford
Dickerson - Harvard University – Extensive
prior work in psychophysiology has shown
subjective experience of arousal and
valence to be closely related to
electrodermal activity (EDA) and facial
electromyographic activity (fEMG),
respectively. The “maturational dualism”
view posits a weakening of mind-body
connection as we age, but there is only
minimal empirical evidence supporting this

hypothesis. In this study, we examined how
age influences the relationship between
affective experience and
psychophysiological responses when
individuals are exposed to affective stimuli.
111 subjects (ages 18 to 81 years) completed
the Affective Reactivity Task, where they
rated 90 images from the International
Affective Picture System on valence and
arousal, while we recorded skin
conductance responses (SCRs) and activity
over both the zygomaticus major and
corrugator supercilii muscle regions on the
face. As expected, an increased number of
skin conductance responses predicted
higher arousal ratings; increased
zygomaticus or decreased corrugator
muscle activity predicted more positive
valence ratings. The relationship between
increased numbers of SCRs and higher
arousal was significantly moderated by age,
such that it was stronger for younger than
older participants. In contrast, the
relationship between fEMG and valence
ratings was not moderated by age. In sum,
the relationship between subjective arousal
and EDA was weakened in older individuals
whereas that between valence and fEMG
was preserved. These findings lend support to
the “maturational dualism” view for arousal
experience, and further suggest that the
relationship between subcomponents of
affective experience and their physiological
correlates evolve differently with aging.

SYMPATHETIC AROUSAL DURING

J. Francisco - University of Missouri - Kansas
City; Amanda S. Bruce - University of Kansas
Medical Center; Robin L. Aupperle - Laureate
Institute for Brain Research – Using an
approach-avoidance paradigm, we
examined the influence different aspects of
a decision may have on skin conductance
responses during decisions. By using a
defined window for decision making, and
using explicit outcome probabilities and
potential rewards, we reduced learning
effects and allowed for a closer examination
of the impact choice certainty, threat, and
potential reward can have on sympathetic
activity during the decision process. Twentyeight participants performed an approachavoidance conflict paradigm, involving
decisions to approach or avoid during
conflict (potential for a negative emotional
image and 2,4,or 6 reward points),

55

!
approach-reward (potential for 2 reward
points only), or avoid-threat (potential for a
negative image, no reward). SCRs were
measured during each decision window.
Self-report measures of behavioral
inhibition/activation, aversions to negative
images, and reward motivation were taken.
Behavioral measures included approach
behavior and behavioral uncertainty. SCRs
increased for conflict decisions involving four
or six points, compared to two [t(27) = -2.21,
p = .036]. Increased behavioral uncertainty
was associated with increased sympathetic
arousal during decisions involving four points
(rs = -.401, p = .034). Higher reward
responsiveness was associated with
decreased SCRs during decisions involving
no reward (rs = -.456, p = .015), and
individuals averse to negative images had
greater increases in SCR as reward increased
(rs = .422, p = .025). Results suggest that
sympathetic arousal during a decision is
influenced by potential outcome variables,
independent of a learning context.
Behavioral uncertainty increased
experienced emotional arousal, and
increased potential reward significantly
intensifies emotional arousal during a
decision.

BARRATT IMPULSIVITY AND NEURAL
REGULATION OF PHYSIOLOGICAL
AROUSAL Sheng Zhang - Yale University; Sien
Hu - Yale University; Jianping Hu - Yale
University; Po-Lun Wu - Yale University; Herta
H. Chao - Yale University; Chiang-Shan R. Li Yale University – Theories of personality have

posited an increased arousal response to
external stimulation in impulsive individuals.
However, there is a dearth of studies
addressing the neural basis of this
association. Here, we recorded skin
conductance in 26 individuals who were
assessed with Barratt Impulsivity Scale (BIS-11)
and performed a stop signal task during
functional magnetic resonance imaging.
Across subjects, higher impulsivity is
associated with greater skin conductance
response (SCR) during stop trials. Activity of
the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC)
negatively correlated to and Granger
caused skin conductance time course
(Zhang et al., Soc Cogn Affect Neurosci.
2014, 9:900-8). Furthermore, higher impulsivity
is associated with a decreased strength of
Granger causality of vmPFC activity on skin
conductance, consistent with diminished
control of physiological arousal to external
stimulation. When men (n=14) and women
(n=12) were examined separately, both
demonstrated a correlation between
impulsivity and SCR to stop trials; however,
the association between impulsivity and
vmPFC regulation of arousal was only
significant in women. Together, these findings
confirmed the link between impulsivity and
heightened arousal to salient stimuli in both
genders and characterized the neural bases
of altered regulation of arousal in impulsive
women. More research is needed to explore
the neural processes of arousal regulation in
impulsive men and in clinical conditions that
implicate poor impulse control.

THE NEURAL DISTINCTION BETWEEN
DISLIKE AND DEHUMANIZATION!Emile G.

Bruneau - Massachusetts Institute of
Technology; Nir Jacoby - Massachusetts
Institute of Technology; Rebecca Saxe Massachusetts Institute of Technology; Nir
Kteily - Kellog School of Management; Adam
Waytz - Kellog School of Management; Sara
Cotterill - Harvard University – Intergroup bias
is often measured using subtle or implicit
scales; however, in the most serious cases of
real world intergroup conflict, outgroup
members are often explicitly and consciously
dehumanized. In previous behavioral
research, we developed a measure of
explicit dehumanization based on the image
of the 'Ascent of Man'. We found blatant
dehumanization in Americans considering
Arabs and Muslims, British considering
Muslims, Hungarians considering the Roma,
and Israelis and Palestinians considering
each other. The novel Ascent scale was a
better predictor of conflict relevant attitudes
and behavior than measures of subtle or
implicit intergroup dehumanization.
However, one concern with the Ascent scale
is that it may merely reflect extreme dislike for
another group, and therefore be a similar
psychological construct to intergroup affect.
We examined this concern directly in a
neuroimaging study by having American
participants rate a number of groups
(including Americans, Muslims and Gypsies)
on the ‘Ascent Dehumanization’ and Feeling
Thermometer scales. We found that the brain
regions that respond parametrically to
ratings on the Ascent Dehumanization and
Feeling Thermometer scales were distinct:
while greater dehumanization ratings
resulted in activity in medial and lateral
precuneus and left premotor cortex, felt
coldness instead resulted in activity in left
anterior insula/operculum; at relaxed
thresholds, parametric warmth (but not
coldness) was represented in medial
precuneus. This study provides neural
evidence that dehumanization and
prejudice judgments involve distinct
cognitive processes.

SOCIAL CONSEQUENCES OF SCENE
CONSTRUCTION: EVIDENCE OF THE
MEDIAL TEMPORAL LOBE SUBSYSTEM
ENHANCING PROSOCIALITY Brendan

Gaesser - Boston College; Liane Young Boston College – Why are we willing to help
others? According to recent behavioral work
on episodic simulation (i.e., the ability to
imagine the self in a specific time and
place), imagining scenes of helping a person
in need increases intentions to help that
person. Here, we provide insight into the
cognitive and neural mechanisms that
enhance prosocial intentions via episodic
simulation. Subjects were scanned as they
imagined helping a person in need,
remembered helping a person in need, and
completed control conditions. The
imagination condition was associated with
increased activation in brain regions within
the medial temporal lobe subsystem of the
default network, including most prominently
the retrosplenial cortex, a region supporting
scene construction and spatial navigation.
ROI analyses revealed that activity in the
retrosplenial cortex predicted the strength of
prosocial intentions. Subjective ratings of
scene coherence also predicted prosocial
intentions. These data reveal a novel
mechanism underlying prosociality,
suggesting that our prosocial decisionmaking is guided, in part, by how vividly we
imagine the spatial context of the helping
episode.

Liang Jing - Chinese Academy of Sciences; Li
Qi - Chinese Academy of Sciences; Liu Xun Chinese Academy of Sciences – Previous
research has shown the effect of group
identity on empathy that people are more
empathetic to in-group members and may
manifest intergroup schadenfreude.
However, the potential role of competitive
attitude on in-group empathy and out-group
schadenfreude has not been investigated.
We tried to explore these effects through a
manipulation of temporarily-formed group

57

membership and investigate the potential
effect of in-group bias or schadenfreude
effect on gambling observation task. At the
beginning of the experiment, a grouping
procedure randomly assigned participants to
a certain group and played a short
antagonistic football game. Then,
participants complemented a gambling task
with fMRI scanning as independent
individuals. We identified the peak “reward
ROI” in neurosynth (e.g., caudate) and found
a significant positive correlation between the
hyper-competitiveness score and the left
caudate activity when the virtual partner
won the gamble (r =0.717, p=0.004) .
Moreover, the hyper-competitiveness score is
also positively correlated with the right
caudate activity when the virtual opponent
lost the gamble (r =0.571, p=0.033) . Such
correlation suggested that people with
higher hyper-competitiveness may seek
more positive feeling in group identity,
showing more in-group bias in momentary
outcome evaluation.

NEURAL MARKERS OF SIMULATION AND
THEIR RELATION TO INTERPERSONAL
FUNCTION: AN FMRI INVESTIGATION!Cora

E. Mukerji - Harvard University; Laura M. Tully –
University of California, Davis; Sarah H. Lincoln
- Harvard University; David Dodell-Feder Harvard University; Hong Yin - Harvard
University; Christine I. Hooker - Harvard
University – Simulation, the generation of
internal representations of others’
experiences, is a process critical to
interpersonal function. Prior research
implicates somatomotor and related cortices
(SC) in facilitating these representations. The
current study aims to (1) isolate SC activation
during simulation and (2) examine its relation
to empathy and social function in
schizophrenia (SZ) and healthy controls (HC).
We hypothesized that reduced SC activation
would be linked to lower empathic and
social function across diagnostic categories.
Our study applied fMRI to investigate this
hypothesis in a sample of 24 HC and 19 SZ
adults. Participants completed a simulation
task in the scanner, in which they watched
videos of another person experiencing pain
in his hand. They were asked to imagine (i.e.,
simulate) how unpleasant this situation would
be for them. Participants also completed a
task to localize the SC region associated with
hand sensation. Lastly, participants
completed measures of social and empathic

function and a 21-day diary measuring reallife interpersonal function. Whole-brain
analyses indicated reduced activation in the
right SC during hand pain simulation in SZ.
Correlational analyses revealed that
activation in the hand-region of the left SC
was associated with greater empathic
concern across SZ and HC groups, controlling
for group (r=0.31, p<.05). Left SC hand-region
activation was also associated with better
social adjustment among HC individuals
(r=.45, p<.05). Ongoing analyses examine
links between neural simulation and real-life
interpersonal function. These findings
indicate that neural simulation processes
support empathic concern across clinical
categories and broader social function
among healthy individuals.

University – Altruistic kidney donors volunteer
to undergo surgery so that one of their own
kidneys can be transplanted into a stranger,
an act often described as one of
“extraordinary altruism.” The neurobiological
basis for this rare form of altruism is not yet
well understood. In the present study, we
recruited 19 living altruistic kidney donors and
20 matched controls and compared resting
state functional connectivity during
functional magnetic resonance imaging
(fMRI). During the seven minute functional
run, participants were instructed to close
their eyes and let their mind wander. Imaging
data were analyzed using AFNI.
Preprocessing included despiking, motion
correction, alignment, spatial smoothing,
and a single regression model including
nuisance regressors, motion censoring, and
bandpass filtering. Group analyses were
conducted using independent samples t
tests. Given the hypothesized role of the
amygdala in extraordinary altruism, a
hypothesis supported by recent findings of
heightened activation of the amygdala in
altruists in response to distress cues (Marsh et
al., 2014), the amygdala was chosen as a
seed region of interest. Supporting the
importance of limbic-prefrontal connectivity
in empathy and altruistic decision-making,

58

!
greater functional connectivity was
observed in altruists between seed voxels in
bilateral amygdala and several clusters in
prefrontal regions, including ventromedial
prefrontal cortex. This pattern of results in
confirmed extraordinary altruists may have
important implications for understanding the
roots of prosocial motivation and behavior,
and for understanding the nature of human
altruism.

MOTIVATIONAL COMPONENTS OF
GROUP IDENTIFICATION SHAPE
ALTRUISTIC BEHAVIOR AND NEURAL
VICARIOUS REWARD RESPONSES!Leor M.

Hackel - New York University; Jamil Zaki Stanford University; Jay J. Van Bavel - New
York University – People regularly act
altruistically by paying a cost to benefit
others, which has been linked in recent work
to neural markers of intrinsic subjective value.
However, social preferences are not stable
across all contexts; rather, the value of an
altruistic act may be shaped by the
motivational significance of a beneficiary’s
social group membership. In a functional MRI
experiment, participants (N = 50) met two
confederates described as part of an ingroup (NYU students) and an out-group
(Columbia students). Participants made
choices to allocate money to themselves or
to one of the two social targets, interspersed
with passive viewing of forced allocations to
themselves or one of the targets. Finally,
participants completed measures of grouplevel self-investment (i.e., importance of the
group) and group level self-definition (i.e.,
similarity to group members). Behavioral data
indicated that altruistic choices depended
on group membership and investment in—
but not definition with—the in-group.
Meanwhile, analyses of fMRI data revealed
that passive viewing of in-group as opposed
to out-group monetary gains was associated
with greater activation in ventromedial
prefrontal cortex—linked in past work to
experienced value—and that the strength of
this activation also correlated with
differences in group-level investment, but not
definition. Thus, while past work has
suggested that perceived similarity to others
may influence vicarious reward, this work
suggests that group boundaries and
motivational components of in-group
identification shape both vicarious reward
and altruistic decisions, with implications for

the study of altruism, neuroeconomics, and
intergroup relations.

HIGHER EMPATHY LEVELS FOR STRANGERS
CORRESPOND WITH HIGHER RIGHT
TEMPORO-PARIETAL JUNCTION AND
ANTERIOR INSULA INTERACTION!Sara

Medina-DeVilliers - University of Virginia; Lane
Beckes - Bradley University; James Coan University of Virginia – We investigated the
association between levels of empathy and
brain activity interaction between the right
temporo-parietal junction (rTPJ) and anterior
insula while anticipating an electric shock to
a stranger. 25 individuals underwent
functional magnetic resonance imaging
(fMRI) while holding a partner’s hand or a
stranger’s hand. During the scan,
participants were presented with randomlyordered threat and safety cues. Threat cues
indicated a 20% chance of shock. Empathy
was measured using the Balanced Emotional
Empathy Scale (BEES). BEES scores were then
used as a covariate in a psychophysiological
interaction model to determine brain activity
interaction in specific regions of interest that
positively and negatively associated with
empathy scores when holding the hands of a
partner and stranger who were threatened
with electric shock. We found that higher
self-reported empathy for strangers
associated with higher brain activity
interaction between the rTPJ and the
anterior insula when participants were
anticipating electric shock to the stranger.
The rTPJ and anterior insula have been
strongly associated with empathy neural
networks in previous empathy research.
Furthermore, the rTPJ has been associated
with more cognitive empathy networks, such
as perspective taking, while the anterior
insula has been associated with more
affective empathy networks, such as
emotion sharing. Therefore, we speculate
that people with higher trait empathy scores
are more likely to employ both cognitive and
affective empathy networks when presented
with the experience of a distressed stranger.
By contrast, we speculate that those lower in
trait empathy employ primarily a cognitive
empathy network when empathizing with
strangers.

!
EMPATHY!Jennifer M. Perry - Tufts University;

Petra C. Schmid - New York University;
Katharina Koch - Sapienza University of
Rome; David M. Amodio - New York
University – Social power is often thought to
decrease empathy for others, yet questions
remain regarding the nature of this effect:
are powerful people insensitive to others’
suffering? Or is there a disconnect between
their sensitivity to suffering and their
expression of empathy? We examined these
questions by testing the effect of power on
subjects’ sensitivity to others’ pain, as
measured by self-report and neural
responses. Participants’ feelings of power
were manipulated with a combination of
power posing (expansive vs. restricted
posture) and imagination of being in high- vs.
low-power situations. Participants then
viewed photographs of hands and feet in
painful and non-painful situations while EEG
was recorded. For each image, participants
rated their personal distress, and amplitude
of the N2 event-related potential, an index of
anterior cingulate activity, was assessed.
Participants then viewed the stimuli again,
rating the pain experienced by the pictured
individuals. Results revealed no effect of
power on ratings of self-distress or other-pain,
or on N2 responses to painful stimuli.
However, for low-power subjects, greater N2
responses to painful stimuli significantly
predicted greater pain ratings, suggesting
their sensitivity to pain guided their empathic
response. This link was not found in highpower participants, suggesting that despite
sensitivity to others’ pain, their expressions of
empathy may be driven by other processes.
These findings suggest a more complex
relationship between power and empathy
that may reflect high-power individuals’
strategic responses rather than an inability to
experience empathy.

EMPATHY REGULATION: NEURAL
CORRELATES AND INDIVIDUAL
DIFFERENCES!Craig Williams - Stanford

University; Emile G. Bruneau – Massachusetts
Institute of Technology; Jamil Zaki - Stanford
University – Empathy can motivate helping,
but can also induce feelings of distress and
‘burnout.’ As such, the ability to flexibly
increase or decrease empathy may be
adaptive. For example, clinicians may
increase their experience of empathy to
connect with patients, or selectively

decrease their empathy to alleviate
‘burnout.’ However, such “empathy
regulation” remains relatively understudied.
We assessed (i) whether people can up- or
down-regulate their empathy for others; (ii)
which neural systems track empathy
regulation; and (iii) whether empathy
regulatory ability tracks salutary outcomes.
Thirty participants read emotionally painful
and neutral stories about other people and
rated their empathic responses while being
scanned with fMRI. Participants were
instructed to adopt either psychologically
close, natural, or distant perspectives while
reading. We found that adopting a close
perspective enhanced participants’
empathy ratings relative to a natural
perspective, and increased activity in a
region of posterior cingulate cortex involved
in considering others’ mental states.
Conversely, adopting a distant perspective
reduced participants’ empathy ratings
relative to a natural perspective, and
decreased activity in fusiform face area and
visual cortical regions associated with facial
and visual processing. Critically, participants’
up- and down-regulatory success failed to
track their self-reported trait empathy.
Instead, greater regulatory success
predicted reduced experience of ‘burnout’
and compassion fatigue. In summary, we
find that (i) individuals can regulate their
experience of empathy; (ii) brain regions
involved in theory of mind and facial/visual
processing track empathic regulation; and
(iii) regulatory success tracks adaptive
individual differences such as reductions in
‘burnout’ and compassion fatigue.

ETHNIC DIFFERENCES IN NEURAL
RESPONSES TO PAIN!Elizabeth A. R. Losin -

University of Miami, University of ColoradoBoulder; Hedwig Eisenbarth - University of
Southampton, University of ColoradoBoulder; Jessica Andrews-Hanna - University
of Colorado-Boulder; Elizabeth Delk University of Colorado-Boulder; Tor D. Wager University of Colorado-Boulder – Pain
negatively impacts health and well-being
and treatment for many is inadequate. One
reason for this may be that pain is not the
same for everyone. An extensive literature
demonstrates that ethnic minority individuals
tend to report more pain than ethnic
majority individuals, given the same clinical
condition or level of experimental stimulation.
Yet, the psychological and neurobiological

60

!
mechanisms underlying ethnic differences in
pain report remain unknown. Such
mechanisms may lie at many different levels
of the pain experience, from differences in
pain physiology in the brain to differences in
thinking about and communicating pain. To
begin to disentangle these potential
mechanisms, we used a machine learningderived pattern of brain activity that has
been linked to nociception and central pain
processing, the neural pain signature. We
compared pain ratings, brain activity (fMRI),
and the relationships between them in a
sample of 31 non-Hispanic white, 29 Hispanic,
and 25 African American individuals
receiving thermal stimulation. Consistent with
previous studies, we found that African
American participants reported more pain
than non-Hispanic white participants at the
same level of thermal stimulation. In contrast,
brain activity within the neural pain signature
did not differ among ethnic groups.
Furthermore, the neural pain signature did
not predict pain ratings equally well across
ethnic groups, suggesting that neural
mechanisms underlying ethnic differences in
pain report may lie outside brain regions
most closely tied to nociception in previous
work. These findings highlight the need for
development of pain biomarkers that
account for sociocultural influences on pain
perception.

individuals and a group of controls were
recruited for a follow-up EEG experiment
which assessed suppression of somatosensory
cortex alpha oscillations, Mu-suppression
(known to reflect somatosensory cortex
activity), during the observation of painful
and neutral images. The findings display
significant Mu-suppression during the
observation of pain images for both controls
and pain responders. Additionally, pain
responders displayed greater Mu-suppression
during pain observations relative to controls
indicating that their experiences may be
manifested in hyperactivity of the
somatosensory cortex. Correlations between
Mu-suppression and measures from the
online questionnaire indicate a link between
increased somatosensory activity and an
increased tendency to localise conscious
vicarious pain experiences to a particular
point on the individual’s own body (as
opposed to generalised bodily pain). Mirrorpain responders report less tendency to
engage in perspective taking on a
questionnaire measure of empathy and, in
this group, less perspective taking is linked to
more increased somatosensory activity for
painful images. Although experiencing the
pain of others is, at one level, ‘empathic’ it
may paradoxically result in less tendency to
put oneself in others shoes.

Carolina at Charlotte – Individuals with
attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder
(ADHD) experience difficulty focusing on
everyday tasks. This difficulty has been linked
with deficits in executive functioning.
Interestingly, it has also been found that
people with ADHD exhibit difficulties with
emotion regulation, which suggests that in
addition to executive deficits, these
individuals may process emotional content
differently. To study how emotional content
interacts with the executive function in
individuals diagnosed with ADHD,
participants diagnosed with ADHD and a
control group performed an emotion n-back
task that measures how emotional content is
updated in working memory. During the
emotion n-back task, participants viewed a
series of facial expressions (happy, sad,

61

!
neutral, angry, and fear) and indicated
whether the currently presented emotional
expression was the same (match-set) or
different (break-set or no-set) as the
emotional expression presented two faces
earlier. Results indicated that while there
were no significant reaction time differences
between groups, participants with ADHD
had significantly lower overall accuracy.
Though the control group exhibited lower
accuracy for sad content than happy,
neutral, angry and fearful expressions,
individuals with ADHD did not show the same
pattern. For sad accuracy levels, there was
no difference between controls and
participants with ADHD. These findings
suggest that individuals with ADHD have
difficulty tracking what emotional content is
relevant vs. irrelevant in working memory.
Furthermore, individuals with ADHD do no
bias sad content the same as controls, which
may underlie reported deficits of empathy in
ADHD.

LOCALIZING THE EXTENDED PAIN MATRIX
AND THE THEORY OF MIND NETWORK
USING VERBAL AND NATURALISTIC
STIMULI!Nir Jacoby - Massachusetts Institute

Koster-Hale - Harvard University; Rebecca
Saxe - Massachusetts Institute of Technology
– A challenge for social cognitive
neuroscience is the absence of a common
framework for relating the results of different
studies to one another. One strategy to
overcome the variability in individual brain
anatomies and function is the use of
functional localizers. A good localizer task
should be short and give robust results at the
single subject level. In this study we compare
three localizer tasks, designed to efficiently
identify regions of interest in social cognitive
neuroscience: the “Extended Pain Matrix”
regions, recruited in response to depictions of
another person’s physical pain, and the
“Theory of Mind network” regions, recruited
in response to depictions of another person’s
mental states (i.e. beliefs and emotions).
Each subject performed all of the tasks. First
we used the False-Belief localizer contrasting
stories about false beliefs versus physical
representations. Second, we contrasted
verbal stories describing physical pain versus
emotional suffering. Finally, participants
watched a Pixar animated short movie,

which included segments depicting physical
pain, and beliefs and emotions. All three
localizers were efficient in identifying the
relevant networks in individuals. There were
subtle but stable differences in the spatial
patterns of activations evoked by the
different tasks. Nevertheless, the regions
identified by each localizer were functionally
similar. These localizers will all be made
publicly available, and can be used to
facilitate a methodological framework for
relating results across studies.

MODULATORY EFFECT OF VIEWING

de gériatrie de Montréal – Imaging studies on
pain communication have shown that the
observation of others’ pain involves brain
regions such as the bilateral anterior insular
and the anterior cingulate cortices.
However, differences in experimental
paradigms and stimuli used across studies
seem to modulate this pattern of brain
activation. We aimed to compare, through a
coordinate-based meta-analysis using
activation likelihood estimation (ALE), the
effect of viewing facial expression of pain
(FEP) and body limbs in pain (BLP) on brain
activation. A literature search in PudMed was
conducted using the key words 'pain' AND
('magnetic resonance imaging' OR 'fMRI' OR
'MRI') AND 'empath*’. We excluded studies
based on these criteria: (i) clinical
population, (ii) no coordinates reported, (iii)
use of complex social stimuli. This yielded 36
studies. We extracted peak coordinate
activations from the contrasts : (i) FEP >
[neutral stimuli or blank screen with fixation],
(ii) BLP > [neutral stimuli]. This yielded 117 foci
from 8 contrasts for FEP and 452 foci from 28
contrasts for BLP. Analyses revealed brain
activation in the anterior insula and the
anterior cingulate cortex for FEP and BLP. FEP
was associated to the superior and inferior

62

!
frontal gyrus and the amygdala. BLP was
related to post-central gyrus activation.
Viewing FEP and BLP was associated to brain
regions involved in the observation and
direct experience of pain but FEP specific
activation was in brain regions involved in
the processing of fear and anxiety, while BLP
specific activation was found in regions
related to the sensory-discriminative
dimension of pain.

CULTURAL MODES OF EXPRESSING
EMOTIONS INFLUENCE HOW EMOTIONS
ARE EXPERIENCED!Mary H. Immordino-Yang

- University of Southern California; Xiao-Fei
Yang - University of Southern California;
Hanna Damasio - University of Southern
California – Cultural ideals are known to
influence emotional expressiveness (Markus
& Kitayama, 1991; Tsai, 2007), but do cultural
influences on expressiveness influence what
emotions “feel like”? 28 Chinese and 29
American young adult participants (aged
18-30 years), recruited in Beijing and in Los
Angeles respectively, reported their feelings
to a series of true, admiration and
compassion inducing stories first in a private
interview, then during fMRI (methods
adapted from Immordino-Yang et al., 2009).
As expected, Americans were more
expressive during the interview. While
expressiveness did not predict stronger
reported feelings or neural responses, more
expressive people showed tighter trial-by-trial
correlations between their experiences of
emotion and activations in visceralsomatosensory cortex (dorsal anterior insula,
dAI), even controlling for individuals’ overall
strength of reactions (neural and felt).
Moreover, expressiveness mediated a
previously described cultural effect in which
dAI activation correlated with feeling
strength only among Americans (ImmordinoYang, Yang & Damasio, 2014). Post-hoc
analyses with a subset of the sample from
whom we had recorded electrocardiograms
simultaneously with fMRI (n=44) revealed that
more expressive individuals also took longer
to decide how strongly they felt and
reached peak activation of dAI later in the
emotion process, despite that neural and
psychophysiological markers of emotion
induction were not delayed. The results
suggest that differences in expressiveness
correspond to differences in how
somatosensory mechanisms contribute to
constructing conscious feelings. By

influencing expressiveness, culture may
therefore influence what emotions “feel like.”

SENSITIVITY TO CONTEXTUAL CUES WHEN
RESOLVING THE VALENCE OF
AMBIGUOUS FACIAL EXPRESSIONS IS
LINKED WITH AMYGDALA-PREFRONTAL
CONNECTIVITY!M. Justin Kim - Dartmouth

College; Randi H. Bennett - Fordham
University; Kimberly M. Solomon - Dartmouth
College; Paul J. Whalen - Dartmouth College
– Resolving ambiguity in the face of
uncertainty is a critical socioemotional
process involving the dynamic interplay
between top-down regulation and bottomup salience. Surprised faces, which are
ambiguous in terms of the emotional
valence of their eliciting event, are well
suited for the purpose of investigating this
process. In Experiment 1, we show that
surprised faces could be reliably categorized
into positive, negative, or truly ambiguous
faces based on their bottom-up stimulusdriven features. In Experiment 2, we
demonstrate that top-down contextual
information can be used to override these
bottom-up stimulus-driven properties during
valence judgments of surprised faces.
Valence ratings based upon contextual
information were used to calculate their
context sensitivity index (CSI), the degree to
which top-down contextual information
influenced valence judgments. In Experiment
3, we used functional magnetic resonance
imaging to show increased amygdala
activity to stimulus-driven negative vs.
positive surprised faces. Furthermore, the
strength of functional connectivity between
this area of the amygdala and rostral
anterior cingulate cortex was correlated with
CSI, indicating that individuals who were
more sensitive to top-down information
showed stronger functional coupling
between the cingulate and the portion of
the amygdala most sensitive to the stimulusdriven features of surprised expressions.
Taken together, we show that surprised
expressions can be a useful tool in probing
the dynamic interplay between top-down
and bottom-up processes. Our results
demonstrate individual differences in the
propensity to use contextual cues to
determine the valence of surprised faces,
and this propensity is associated with greater
coupling between the amygdala and
prefrontal cortex.

University; Walter Mischel - Columbia

University – A large body of research
indicates that socioeconomic status (SES) is
positively associated with physical and
emotional wellbeing. While many studies
have focused on the relationship between
SES and mental health, relatively few have
examined the neural mechanisms by which
SES might impact psychological wellbeing.
In the current study we examined whether
SES impacts the way children respond to
emotional events. To answer this question,
we tested 109 healthy individuals, aged 6 to
22 (M age=14.8, 64 Female) on a wellestablished fMRI paradigm in which
participants viewed neutral and upsetting
social images, while being instructed to
either (a) respond naturally, (b) imagine they
are a part of the social scenes, or (c)
imagine themselves as far away from the
social scenes. To assess SES, subjects or their
parents were asked to report their household
income using the Hollingshead SES Index.
When viewing the upsetting images, subjects
from high-SES families tended to report less
negative affect than did subjects from lowSES families. Additionally, we found that
high-SES subjects recruited the ventromedial
prefrontal cortex, a region strongly
implicated in self-relevant processing (Roy,
Shohamy, & Wager, 2012) and emotional
value assessment (D’Argembeau, 2013), to a
greater extent than did low-SES subjects.
These results provide evidence that
individuals from more affluent backgrounds
experience less negative affect, even when
responding naturally, in response to aversive
social events than their less affluent
counterparts, and that this disparity may be
due to differences in self-relevant emotional
processing.

AGE-BY-VALENCE INTERACTIONS IN
MEMORY RETRIEVAL PROCESSES: AN
EVENT-RELATED POTENTIAL STUDY!Jaclyn
H. Ford - Boston College; Elizabeth A

Kensinger - Boston College – Recent
functional magnetic resonance imaging
(fMRI) studies report significant age-byvalence interactions in neural recruitment
during memory retrieval, suggesting that
emotion may influence memory processes
differently in young and older adults.
However, preliminary fMRI data from our lab
suggest that age differences shift over the
course of retrieval, as participants move from
search to elaboration. This finding suggests a
time-by-age-by-valence interaction that is
difficult to elucidate using fMRI. Thus, the
current study used event related potentials
(ERPs) to examine these interactions within
the first second of retrieval. Participants (ages
18-85) encoded positive, negative, and
neutral images paired with neutral titles. ERPs
were acquired during a retrieval task in
which participants were presented with titles
and asked whether each had been seen
with an image during encoding. ERPs to hits
(correctly identifying an “old” word) and
correct rejections (correctly identifying a
“new” word) were compared to examine
the effects of emotion and age on memory
effects. Consistent with prior studies, young
adults exhibited an early (200-400ms poststimulus) anterior old/new effect and a late
(600-800ms post-stimulus) posterior effect.
Interestingly, old/new effects in young adults
were greatest for neutral relative to positive
and negative stimuli. Healthy aging was
associated with decreased old/new effects,
although this decrease was greater for
neutral stimuli relative to negative and
positive. Critically, our data suggest
differences in the time course of old/new
effects for positive and negative stimuli in
older adults, suggesting that the age-byvalence interactions in neural recruitment
are more complex than could be measured
using fMRI.

the whites of the sclera can impact neural

of open mouths, grimaces, and smiles, both
with and without teeth. A continuous 256

while participants completed two tasks,
evaluating stimulus color or expression
valence. Independent components analysis
identified and removed EEG trials with eye
blinks, muscle movements and electrical
noise. For each participant, averaged ERPs in
two temporo-occipital electrode clusters
were generated by subject and condition;
peak P100, N170 and P250 amplitudes and
latencies were analyzed in a 3 X 2 X 2 X 2
repeated-measures ANOVA with Mouth
Configuration, Teeth Presence, Task and
Hemisphere as factors, followed by post-hoc
Bonferroni adjustments. P100 and N170
amplitudes were significantly larger when
teeth were present, F(1,12)= 5.79, p=0.03,
and F(1,12)=17.72, p= 0.001, respectively,
with a marginally significant main effect
occurring for P250, F(1,12)= 4.34, p=0.06.
There was an additional main effect of
Mouth Configuration for N170, wherein
grimaces and smiles elicited larger N170s
compared to open mouths, F(1,12)=11.01,
p=0.006 and F(1,12)=10.34, p=0.007,
respectively. Our data correspond with facial
expression studies of N170 enhancement to
angry (Krombholz et al., 2007), fearful and
happy expressions (e.g. Luo et al., 2010), and
point to low-level visual stimulus features,
such as teeth, potentially driving neural
responses to affect independent of mouth
configuration.

– Emotion recognition training (ERT) has
shown promise in modifying cognitive biases
associated with low mood (Penton-Voak et
al., 2012) and can be easily delivered via
computer or smartphone applications. Using
a novel paradigm we conducted a

randomised controlled trial of the effects of
ERT on amygdala response to facial
expressions of emotion, in order to explore
the neural mechanism of action of this
intervention in a sample of individuals with
depressive symptoms. We randomised 36
adults from the general population who
reported high levels of depressive symptoms
(≥ 14 on the Beck Depression Inventory-II) to
five consecutive daily sessions of the ERT
intervention or control procedure, followed
by an fMRI scan on the final training day.
Region of interest analysis demonstrated
significant group differences in the neural
response to happy vs. sad stimuli in the left
amygdala, with activation greater in the
trained versus control groups. This effect was
driven by amygdala responses to happy
faces, with an 8% increase in amygdala
activation in the trained group relative to a
4% reduction in the control group relative to
resting state. Our findings suggest that
computerised training (ERT) using a novel
cognitive bias modification technique
targeting emotional processing in depression
resulted in greater neural activation to
positive faces relative to negative faces. This
effect is similar to those of antidepressants in
depressed individuals, raising the possibility
that ERT may be a valuable and costeffective adjunctive treatment for
depression.

AFFECTIVE NEUROSCIENCE PERSONALITY
SCALE AND CLINICAL
SYMPTOMATOLOGY: A NEUROSCIENCE
UNDERSTANDING OF THE CROSS BETWEEN
PERSONALITY AND PSYCHOPATHOLOGY!

Francis L. Stevens - Wheelock College –
Increasing biomarkers have been identified
to better classify and understand
psychopathology. Recent research suggests
that personality may have distinct grounding
in emotional brain system (Davis & Panksepp,
2011). Davis & Panksepp (2011) hypothesize
that these early evolutionary subcortical
areas functionally notable for emotion, are
the same regions for the basis of one’s
personality. They see personality as being
based on one’s primary emotional
temperaments, and thus, one’s personality
has neuroscience markers within these
subcortical areas (Panksepp & Biven, 2012).
Given the above theory, this study examined
the Affective Neuroscience Personality Scale
(ANPS) in its relationship to the Brief

65

!
Symptoms Inventory (BSI), measure of clinical
symptomatology, to see if distinct symptom
patterns appear by affective neuroscience
type. Understanding the relationships
between the brain’s biological structure,
personality, and mental health conditions
would help to provide a comprehensive
neuroscience-based model between
individual’s personality and psychopathology
type. Results indicate that the ANPS is not a
strong measure in its ability to distinguish
amongst various types of psychopathology.
The ANPS scale does distinguish between
positive and negative affect states by
amongst the various scales. Limitations still
exist in developing measures with direct
neuroscience correlates.

THE INTERPLAY BETWEEN EMOTIONS AND
COGNITIVE TASK PERFORMANCE!Gerly

Tamm - University of Tartu, University of
Missouri; Nelson Cowan, University of Missouri
– Recently, it has been suggested that both
working memory accuracy and IQ are tightly
connected with individual emotional
characteristics (Yoon et al., 2014; Spachtholz
et al., 2014; Owens et al., 2014; Storbeck et
al., 2015). However, so far, little is known
about the interaction of individual emotional
state and cognitive performance, taking also
into account the time course of the
procedure. The first goal was to compare the
effects of emotional traits and states on
cognitive task performance in general.
Second, we expected individuals’ emotional
states to depend on task performance, so
that subjects with higher accuracy in
cognitive tasks would have more positive
emotional state reports. Self-report
questionnaires were used to measure
emotions. Seven emotional state reports
were made during a 2-hour session, along
with a change-detection visual working
memory task, a Raven's Matrices test of fluid
intelligence, and additional emotion and
aptitude tasks. In our pilot sample (n=48), we
find that emotional state characteristics
correlate with task performance more
strongly than emotional traits. The same
levels of valence, arousal, and feelings of
control (dominance) were maintained
throughout the experimental procedure by
high-performing subjects (as measured on
either change-detection or Raven's tasks). In
contrast, low-performing subjects started out
the same emotionally, but declined in
emotional state and dominance as the

working memory task progressed. Their state
improved again when the difficult tasks
ended. Our preliminary results demonstrate
that task difficulty affects emotional valence,
arousal and dominance; however,
emotional predispositions can contribute to
this.

TASK-EVOKED BRAIN ACTIVITY AFTER
NEGATIVE INDUCTION PREDICTS
ENHANCEMENT OF MEMORY FOR
NEUTRAL MATERIAL!Morenikeji Adebayo -

General Hospital; Joseph Andreano Harvard Medical School, Massachusetts
General Hospital; Alexandra Touroutoglou Harvard Medical School, Massachusetts
General Hospital; Bradford Dickerson Harvard Medical School, Massachusetts
General Hospital; Lisa Feldman Barrett Northeastern University, Harvard Medical
School, Massachusetts General Hospital –
Previous research has shown that activity in
regions of the salience network (SN) during
the encoding of negative stimuli predicts
later successful subsequent memory (LaBar &
Cabeza, 2006). Behavioral experiments have
also shown that arousing experiences
temporally adjacent to the encoding of
neutral stimuli enhance memory (Anderson
et al., 2006). We tested the hypothesis that
task-related activation of salience regions
during a negative affect induction would
predict enhancement of memory for neutral
material on an encoding task immediately
following induction. 41 young adults each
completed two scan sessions, approximately
1 week apart. In the first session participants
underwent a negative affect induction, then
completed a neutral paired associate
memory task. The second session was
identical, except a neutral pre-encoding
affect induction was used. We measured
memory enhancement (∆d’) by subtracting
the signal detection score under neutral
induction from the signal detection score
under negative induction. We measured SN
reactivity by contrasting activity during
negative vs. neutral affect induction. Linear
regression was used to examine the
relationship between salience reactivity and
∆d’ due to affect. A significant relationship
between induction activity and ∆d’ was
found in two major SN nodes (anterior insula
& anterior cingulate cortex). A similar trend
approaching significance was also observed

66

!
in the amygdala. These findings confirm
previous research that shows the
motivational relevance of neutral material
can be enhanced by affect. They are the
first to demonstrate that activity in the SN
during affect induction, prior to encoding,
predicts the magnitude of memory
enhancement for neutral material.

BRAIN BASES OF SOCIAL AFFECTIVE
EXPERIENCE: A META-ANALYSIS OF
HUMAN NEUROIMAGING STUDIES!Michael

H. Parrish - University of North Carolina at
Chapel Hill; Jeffrey A Brooks - University of
North Carolina at Chapel Hill; Holly Shablack
- University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill;
Kristen Lindquist - University of North Carolina
at Chapel Hill – Human beings are social
animals. It thus stands to reason that
affective experiences that occur in social
contexts are particularly evocative to
humans. Although recent meta-analyses
explored the neural basis of human affect
and emotion (Kober et al. 2008; Lindquist et
al. 2012; Vytal & Hamann, 2009), no research
to date has systematically explored how the
brain responds during social v. non-social
affective experiences. To address this
question, we performed a meta-analysis of
the neuroimaging literature using 86 studies
(182 contrasts) of affect and emotion
published between 1992 to 2013. We used
the Multivel Kernel Density Analysis to assess
whether there are relative differences in
neural activity during affective experiences
in response to social stimuli (including other
people) versus non-social stimuli (not
including other people). We found more
consistent activation in the left anterior insula
(AI) during social v. non-social affective
experiences. A second analysis revealed that
this effect is driven by the experience of
unpleasant affect in social contexts.
Unpleasant, social experiences resulted in
consistent activity in the AI, anterior cingulate
cortex (ACC), caudate, pre-SMA and
amygdala; there were no consistent
activations associated with pleasant, social
experiences, however. The brain areas
observed comprise the “salience network”
that is implicated in attention (Corbetta &
Shulman, 2008) and highly arousing affective
experiences (Seeley et al. 2007; Touroutoglou
et al. 2011). Our findings thus suggest that
social contexts may tune the experience of
affect, resulting in greater vigilance and
more arousal.

EFFECT OF LOW LEVEL FEATURES ON
AFFECTIVE STATES IDENTIFICATION FOR
THE AUDIOVISUAL STIMULI!Jongwan Kim -

University of South Carolina; Douglas H.
Wedell - University of South Carolina;
Svetlana V. Shinkareva - University of South
Carolina – Recent research has
demonstrated that affective states elicited
by viewing sets of pictures varying in valence
and arousal are identifiable from the
distributed whole brain activation patterns
(Baucom, et al., 2012). One of the
challenges for studying affective responses
to individual stimuli is the possible
confounding of lower level features of the
stimuli. For example, valence is positively
correlated with brightness and arousal is
related to loudness and motion. The current
work investigated whether affective states
can be identified for dynamic naturalistic
stimuli presented in an incidental affective
processing paradigm while controlling for low
level features. Eleven participants were
presented with audiovisual stimuli reflecting
valence and arousal in an fMRI experiment.
Multivoxel pattern analysis was used to
predict valence and arousal within
participants within areas responsive to
naturalistic audiovisual presentation,
independent of affective content and
primary perception. The visual (hue,
saturation, and brightness), acoustical
(frequency and amplitude), and six motion
components for each stimulus were
regressed out as covariates representing
possible confounds. Five low-level features
components were generated from three
separate PC analyses and residuals were
used for further analysis. Results
demonstrated above chance (p < .05)
identification of valence and arousal of the
stimuli within participants, with accuracies
comparable to previous work. Valence of
audiovisual stimuli was significantly identified
in 10 out of 11 participants and arousal was
identified in 8. The results demonstrated that
valence and arousal information lies within
distributed brain regions responsive to video
watching controlling for potentially
confounding low level features of the stimuli.

FACIAL EMOTION RECOGNITION AMONG
OLDER ADULTS WITH UNIPOLAR
DEPRESSION Paulo Shiroma - University of
Minnesota – Background: The “mood

67

!
congruency hypothesis” posits the tendency
to attribute negative emotions to neutral
faces in depressed patients. This negative
bias might be a trait characteristic
independent of mood improvement
explaining why remitted patients are still
vulnerable to development of further
depressive episodes. The phenomenon of
distorted emotion processing among older
adults with depression has not been
adequately examined.
Methods: Three groups of older adults (≥60
years-old) free of antidepressant [active
major depression (MDa), N=30; remitted
major depression (MDr), N=15; neverdepressed controls (NDc), N=15] were
compared in a computerized emotion
recognition task. Main outcomes were
accuracy and reaction time to identify
happy facial expression portrayed at
different emotional intensities (0%, 25%, 50%,
75% and 100%). Covariates included
executive functions, anxiety level, medical
comorbidity, level of subjective stress, and
level of social support.
Results: Overall, there was a statistically
significant difference in accuracy to identify
happy expressions (F=5.77, df=60, p=0.005)
(ND=83.9% vs MDa=75.4% vs MDr=75.5%).
Reaction time was not statistically different
among three groups (F=1.25, df=59.7,
p=0.294) (ND=521 ms vs MDa=664 ms vs
MDr=617 ms). Stratification of facial stimuli by
intensity showed a decreased accuracy at
25% and 50% intensity across the 3 groups
with ceiling effect at 0, 75 and 100% intensity.
Conclusions: Negative bias measured by
facial emotion identification appears as a
vulnerability factor for depression that
extends to older adults. Further studies would
be necessary to examine whether correction
of emotional bias may improve response and
prevent relapse in late-life depression.

ANXIETY MODULATES INSULA
ACTIVATION TO PRECISE VERSUS
SIMPLIFIED MENTAL REPRESENTATIONS OF
RISK!Christina F. Chick - Cornell University;

Valerie F. Reyna - Cornell University; Roni A.
Setton - Cornell University; Rebecca B.
Weldon - Cornell University – We tested
whether different mental representations of
numerical information could change insula
activation to identical risks. We measured
trait anxiety in 31 adults, who also completed
a risky-choice framing task in an MRI scanner.

With either lives or money at stake, options
were presented as gains or losses.
Participants chose between (a) a sure option
and (b) a risky option that offered either no
reward (or loss), or some probability of a
larger reward (or loss). For each scenario,
sure and risky options were equal in
expected value. Subjects were cued to
compare the options using either simplified
(categorical) or precise (numerical) mental
representations. Higher trait anxiety was
associated with more activation in the
anterior insula when subjects chose a risky
loss compared to a sure loss. Moreover,
precision of mental representation
modulated insula activation to risks. When
subjects were cued to represent risks in a
simplified manner (e.g., some gain or loss vs.
no gain or loss), higher anxiety was
associated with more insula activation during
risk-averse behavior. However, when
subjects were cued to represent risks
precisely (e.g., exact probabilities), higher
anxiety was associated with more insula
activation during risk-seeking behavior.
Therefore, higher trait anxiety was associated
with higher insula activation for opposite
behaviors (choosing a risk versus avoiding a
risk), depending on the precision with which
subjects represented the identical risk
scenario. These results suggest that mental
representations of risk can modulate the
relationship between anxiety and neural
responses to risk, representing a potential
new target for intervention.

SEQUENTIAL FORAGING UNDER ACUTE
AND CHRONIC STRESS!Jennifer K. Lenow -

New York University; Sara M. Constantino New York University; Nathaniel D. Daw - New
York University; Elizabeth A. Phelps - New York
University – Many of the decisions that
humans make (e.g., whether to change jobs)
are analogous to sequential foraging
decisions between current known and future
unknown quantities. Stress has been shown to
influence cognitive, affective, and
neurophysiological processes that generally
support this class of decision-making, yet we
know little about how these influences
converge to bias foraging decisions at the
behavioral level. For the current study, we
measured individuals’ levels of stress by
assessing subjective responses of chronic
and global life stress and by measuring
changes in cortisol in response to an acute
mild physical stressor (or matched control

68

!
task). In a subsequent foraging task, subjects
repeatedly decided whether to harvest a
currently displayed tree for apples or travel
to a new tree, weighing the travel time it
takes to get to a new tree against the
diminishing returns of the current tree.
Optimal foraging theory prescribes that one
should leave a current option when its
marginal reward rate falls to the average
reward rate of the environment. We tested
how stress related to the thresholds at which
participants left currently diminishing trees in
aspiration of a better tree. We find that both
acute physiological and chronic subjective
stress bias human decision-makers toward
overexploiting current resources, indicating a
depreciation of overall environment quality.
These findings have important implications
for understanding how and to what extent
stress might affect real-world decisions about
weighing current known and future unknown
options.

examined group (MDD/MDD-SAD), attention
(attended/ignored faces), and emotion
(fearful/neutral) as predictors of accuracy.
There was a significant three-way interaction
of group-attention-emotion on accuracy
(F(1,51)=5.62, p=.02). MDD subjects showed
higher accuracy when attending to fearful
compared to neutral faces (t(24)=2.52,
p=.02) and lower accuracy when ignoring
fearful compared to neutral faces (t(24)=2.25, p=.03). For MDD-SAD subjects,
accuracy was low in both affective
conditions. While the MDD group showed an
advantage when attending to fear faces
and a disadvantage when ignoring them,
the MDD-SAD group performance poorly on
both emotion conditions. The comorbid
group’s pattern of enhanced vigilance to all
emotional information corroborates prior
research showing that SAD is associated with
a bias to interpret all social stimuli as
threatening.

– Major depressive disorder (MDD) is
associated with difficulty disengaging from
negative information, while social anxiety
disorder (SAD) is linked to a negative
interpretation style for ambiguous social
stimuli. Although MDD and SAD are
frequently comorbid, there is limited research
on emotional attention bias in this
population. In this study, individuals with MDD
and MDD-SAD performed a matching task
while exposed to emotional interference. We
hypothesized that comorbid SAD would be
associated with increased distraction in
response to all face stimuli irrespective of
affective valence. Twenty-eight subjects with
MDD-SAD and 25 with MDD completed the
Emotional Interference Task. On each 250ms
trial, subjects determined whether two stimuli
on the horizontal or vertical axis matched,
while ignoring stimuli on the other axis. Stimuli
were fearful faces, neutral faces or houses. A

STRESS AND EMPATHY: INTACT CAPACITY
TO IDENTIFY EMOTIONAL STATE BUT
IMPAIRED ABILITY TO TAKE ON ANOTHER’S
EMOTION!Siobhan Hoscheidt - Duke
University; Daniel Wei - Duke University; Kevin
LaBar - Duke University – Empathy is the
ability to recognize and vicariously
experience the emotions of another person.
Empathy is defined along two dimensions:
cognitive and emotional. Cognitive empathy
is the capacity to identify another person’s
emotional state independently of one’s own
affective state. Emotional empathy is a shift
in affective state towards that of another
person. Cognitive and emotional empathy
are most often salient in distress situations,
which likely induce stress responses. To date,
no studies have directly manipulated and
examined the effects of stress on multiple
dimensions of empathy. This study examined
the effects of stress on cognitive and
emotional empathy. Participants underwent
a stress induction, the socially evaluated
cold-pressor task (SECPT), or a matched
control task. Participants completed the
Multifaceted Empathy Test (MET) composed
of forty pictures (20 positive affect, 20
negative affect) of individuals conveying an
emotional state. Cognitive empathy was
assessed through the ability to choose the
correct descriptor for the emotion depicted
in the picture in a multiple-choice paradigm.
Participants were asked to indicate how

69

!
much they empathized with a person using a
scale from “not at all” to “a lot” as a
measure of emotional empathy. Stress and
control groups performed equivalently on
cognitive empathy. Stress participants
showed significantly impaired emotional
empathy. Results provide evidence that
cognitive and emotional empathy are
distinct processes and that stress selectively
impairs one’s ability to take on the affective
state of another. Findings suggest that stress
shifts individuals to a less emotionally
empathic state, perhaps as an evolutionary
adaptation for self-preservation.

AMYGDALA-PREFRONTAL WHITE MATTER
INTEGRITY AND PERCEIVED STRESS!

Samantha N. Jacobs - Dartmouth College;
James M. Taylor - Dartmouth College; Robert
S. Chavez - Dartmouth College; M. Justin Kim
- Dartmouth College; Paul J. Whalen Dartmouth College – The extant literature on
amygdala-prefrontal white matter anatomy
suggests that increased structural integrity
may play a protective role. Decreased
fractional anisotropy (FA), a numeric
descriptor of water diffusion directionality in
white matter, within amygdala-prefrontal
pathways has been linked to a host of
clinical outcomes, including major
depression disorder, social anxiety disorder,
and post-traumatic stress disorder.
Moreover, recent animal models in rats and
non-human primates suggest that chronic,
early-life stress is related to decreased
myelination in homologous tracts extending
anteriorly from the amygdala. The present
study builds on this research, proposing a
structural underpinning of the diminished
capacity to cope with perceived stress.
Participants underwent two 61-direction
diffusion imaging scans and a high-resolution
anatomical scan. After the scan session,
participants completed Cohen’s “Perceived
Stress Scale”. Amygdala regions of interest
(ROIs) were defined separately for each
participant using subcortical parcellations of
their T1 scan. These ROIs were used as seed
regions for probabilistic tractography, and
tract correspondence was next compared
across individuals. We then correlated mean
FA values from each bilateral tract with
participants’ perceived stress scores.
Bootstrapped confidence intervals and
estimates of effect size with 10,000 replicates
reveal a significant inverse relationship that is
present bilaterally, though stronger in the

right (r=-0.498, bootstrapped 95% CIs -0.770, 0.137) than in the left (r=-0.428, bootstrapped
95% CIs -0.701, -0.018) hemisphere. These
results suggest that amygdala-prefrontal
integrity may be a biomarker of individual
differences in ability to handle stress, and in
the future, may aid in identifying those at-risk
for developing anxiety disorders.!!

THE EFFECTS OF REPEATED QUESTIONING
ON EYEWITNESS MEMORY UNDER
CONDITIONS OF STRESS!Jessica M.

Karanian - Boston College; Linda A. Henkel Fairfield University – Information obtained
from eyewitness interviews is notoriously
unreliable. Laboratory research
demonstrates that repeated questioning can
decrease both memory accuracy and
confidence. Furthermore, elevated levels of
cortisol at the time of memory retrieval can
induce significant memory impairments.
Despite the common co-occurrence of
repeated questioning and stress in real-world
eyewitness circumstances, these two factors
have not been studied in conjunction. In the
present study, we investigated the effects of
repeated questioning and stress on
eyewitness memory. We hypothesized that
the memory impairments that typically result
from repeated questioning would be
exacerbated under conditions of stress.
Accordingly, we implemented a paradigm
to recreate a real-world eyewitness
experience. All participants (N=50) played
the role of an eyewitness to a videotaped
crime scene in which a theft occurs, and
then participants underwent either a stressful
(n=25) or neutral (n=25) psychosocial
manipulation. Following a 30-minute delay,
participants were questioned about the
witnessed crime. Then, regardless of
performance, participants were requestioned. To measure stress levels, two
saliva samples were collected (baseline,
post-stress), and participants also completed
three self-reports of affect. Our preliminary
behavioral analyses revealed that
participants exposed to the stress
manipulation changed significantly more
accurate responses to “I don’t know” when
re-questioned. Furthermore, when collapsing
over conditions (control, stress), self-reports of
high negative affect immediately prior to
questioning were associated with
significantly more response changes from
accurate to inaccurate during requestioning. These preliminary results suggest

70

!
that the memory impairments typically
associated with repeated eyewitness
questioning are exacerbated under
conditions of psychological stress.

REDUCED DORSOLATERAL PREFRONTAL
CORTEX ACTIVITY FOLLOWING SOCIAL
CHALLENGE IN INDIVIDUALS AT FAMILIAL
RISK FOR SCHIZOPHRENIA!Erik C. Nook -

Harvard University; David Dodell-Feder Harvard University; Juston Osborne - Harvard
University; Jill M. Hooley - Harvard University;
Lynn E. DeLisi - Boston VA Medical Center,
Harvard Medical School; Christine I. Hooker Harvard University – Schizophrenia is
associated with severe impairments in social
functioning, and a growing body of research
shows that individuals who have family
members with schizophrenia also show
atypical social cognitive abilities. However,
little is known about how people who are at
familial high risk (FHR) for schizophrenia
respond to social situations that are
emotionally evocative, even though
resilience to social conflict is an important
socioaffective skill. Here, we used a wellestablished social challenge task to test the
hypothesis that FHR individuals show reduced
activity in regions commonly implicated in
emotion regulation following criticism.
Twenty-one FHR participants who have at
least two relatives with schizophrenia and 19
healthy controls completed the “Expressed
Emotion” task while in the fMRI scanner.
Participants heard positive, negative and
neutral comments about a person, and they
were told to imagine that each comment
was directed at them. Hence, this task
simulates the experience of being criticized,
being praised and hearing a neutral
comment about oneself. Standard
preprocessing and analysis techniques were
used to model how each group responded
to the critical comment, as compared to the
neutral comment. As hypothesized, FHR
participants showed reduced activity in the
right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
compared to healthy controls after listening
to the critical vignette. This result suggests
that people at familial risk for schizophrenia
may be impaired in regulating negative
emotions aroused by social conflicts such as
criticism.

GAME ON!: BIOBEHAVIORAL INDIVIDUAL
DIFFERENCES IN THE ACUTE STRESSREDUCTION EFFECTS OF A MOBILE
ATTENTION BIAS MODIFICATION GAME
FOR ANXIETY!Laura Egan - Hunter College

Babkirk - The Graduate Center of The City
University of New York; Samantha Berthod The Graduate Center of The City University of
New York; Olga Gulyayeva - Hunter College
of The City University of New York; Peter
Luehring-Jones - Hunter College of The City
University of New York; Tracy A Dennis Hunter College of The City University of New
York – Exaggerated attention to threat is a
potential causal mechanism in anxiety.
Attention bias modification training (ABMT)
targeting this threat bias reduces both
clinical and subclinical symptoms of anxiety.
ABMT can be effectively embedded in a
gamified format (an iOS application, or app),
but little is understood about individual
differences that moderate its efficacy. Scalprecorded event-related potentials (ERPs)
were used to examine whether individual
differences in distinct neurocognitive
responses to threat – attention allocation
(P1), configural processing (N170), emotional
evaluation (P2), and cognitive control (N2) –
influenced acute effects of a gamified ABMT
mobile app in 42 (21 females) trait anxious
adults. Following app play (ABMT versus
placebo), subjective anxiety and stress
reactivity (observed and self-reported) were
measured. ABMT versus placebo resulted in
lower stress reactivity among those
evidencing one of three patterns of
neurocognitive processing of threat: those
showing less attention allocation [P1: F(1, 37)
= 5.71, p = .02, R2 = .11] or more configural
processing of threat [N170: F(1, 37) = 7.53, p =
.01, R2 = .15] prior to training, and those
showing sustained attention allocation
following training [P1: F(1, 36) = 4.70, p = .04,
R2 = .08]. ABMT increased the magnitude of
attention control responses to threat, but
only among males [N2: F(1, 37) = 6.70, p =
.04, partial η2 = .11]. Results illustrate the need
to consider individual differences relevant to
the role of early neurocognitive processing of
threat in the acute stress-reduction effects of
gamified ABMT.!!

DOMAINS!Oriel FeldmanHall - New York

University; Candace Raio - New York
University; Jennifer Kubota - University of
Chicago; Morgan Seiler - New York University;
Elizabeth A. Phelps - New York University –
Although previous research suggests that
non-social risky choices can be
compromised under stress, little is known
about how we navigate risky social
exchanges under stress. Here we examine
the interaction between stress and social
decision-making. Subjects played a nonsocial gambling game and a conceptually
matched trust game with multiple unique
partners—where trust was operationalized as
the willingness to invest in partners who can
reciprocate monetary exchanges—after
either control or stress manipulations.
Subjects who were not under stress showed
no differences between money spent to
gamble and money entrusted to partners. In
contrast, stressed subjects spent more money
gambling but less money in the trust game,
exhibiting increased risk-taking in a nonsocial context but decreased risk-taking in a
social context. To further decompose how
stress differentially affects how individuals
value risk in social versus non-social contexts,
we modeled the effect of feedback (i.e.
winning or losing in the gambling task, and
partners who reciprocated or defected in
the trust task). Regardless of stress, subjects
were highly attuned to feedback in nonsocial contexts, believing that every
incremental loss leads to a greater chance
of winning on the next trial (gamblers’
fallacy). In contrast, non-stressed subjects
behaved rationally and did not incorporate
feedback when deciding to trust another, in
essence treating each new interaction
independently from previous experiences.
However, these adaptive social decisions
broke down under stress, as subjects
became highly sensitive to irrelevant social
feedback under stress.

INTOLERANCE OF UNCERTAINTY AND THE
REINFORCEMENT RATE OF THREAT: A
STARTLE ELECTROMYOGRAPHY
INVESTIGATION!Brian Chin - Stony Brook
University; Brady D. Nelson - Stony Brook
University; Felicia Jackson - Stony Brook
University; Greg Hajcak - Stony Brook
University – Intolerance of uncertainty (IU) is
the tendency to perceive or experience
uncertainty as unpleasant or stressful.

Previous research has demonstrated that IU is
associated with aberrations in emotional and
motivational responding in anticipation of
temporally uncertain threat. However, few
studies have examined whether high IU
individuals are also sensitive to other features
of threat that can vary in predictability. The
present study examined whether IU was
associated with the startle electromyography
response during conditions of low vs. high
threat reinforcement predictability.
Specifically, 45 participants completed a selfreport measure of IU and a fear learning task
in which the conditioned stimulus was
reinforced with an electric shock to the
forearm on 50% of trials in one block and 75%
of trials in a second block. The startle
response was measured during each threat
condition. Results indicated that, across all
participants, the startle response was greater
during the 75% relative to the 50%
reinforcement condition. However, IU was
positively correlated with the startle response
during the 50%, but not the 75%,
reinforcement condition. In other words,
despite receiving fewer electric shocks
during the 50% reinforcement condition,
individuals with high IU demonstrated greater
defense system activation. The association
between IU and startle was independent of
state anxiety. The present study adds to a
growing literature suggesting IU is associated
with abnormal emotional and motivational
responding in the context of uncertain
threat. Future research is needed to
determine whether increasing tolerance of
uncertainty subsequently impacts
psychobiological measures of sensitivity to
uncertain threat.

REJECTION SENSITIVITY IS RELATED TO
ALTERED NEURAL PROCESSING OF FEAR!

Naoyuki Sunami - Western Illinois University;
Alicia Vallorani - Western Illinois University;
Sandra L. McFadden - Western Illinois
University; Masu Omura - Western Illinois
University; Elizabeth M. Kiebel - Western Illinois
University; Kristine M. Kelly - Western Illinois
University – Rejection sensitivity (RS) is
characterized by the fear of and
overreaction to interpersonal rejection
(Downey, & Feldman, 1996). Multiple studies
have shown increased dorsal anterior
cingulate cortex (dACC) activity in
individuals high in RS when viewing socially
threatening stimuli, such as disapproving
faces (Burklund, Eisenberger, & Lieberman,

72

!
2007) and scenes of rejection (Kross, Egner,
Oschner, Hirsch, & Downey, 2007), but not
when viewing fear-based images. Other
research has shown the dACC to be
involved in fear processing (Milad, et al.,
2007) as well as trait anxiety (Sehlmeye, et al.,
2011) and catastrophizing (Kalisch, Gerlicher,
& Anna, 2014). Because RS is associated with
both trait anxiety (Koseki, Suyama, Kaneko, &
Suzuki, 2014) and social anxiety (Sun, & Woo,
2011), it is possible that individuals high in RS
are hypervigilant toward fearful situations in
general and not only toward rejection.
A sample of 32 undergraduate students
completed a measure of RS and then
performed an emotion-labeling task while
event related potentials were recorded.
Individuals high in RS reported typical feelings
and exhibited typical neural responses for
images intended to elicit sadness,
amusement and contentment (images from
Mikels et al., 2005). When looking at images
that typically evoke fear, however,
individuals high in RS had more negative late
slow-wave activity (r = -.47), consistent with
higher distress, more negative appraisal and
lower approach motivation (White et al.,
2014). The findings suggest that individuals
high in RS may be more susceptible to fear in
general rather than only fearing rejection.

ALTERED NEURAL REGULATION OF
EMOTIONAL PROCESSING IN
CHRONICALLY VICTIMIZED GIRLS!Michelle

E. Miernicki - University of Illinois at UrbanaChampaign; Karen D. Rudolph - University of
Illinois at Urbana-Champaign; Eva H. Telzer University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign –
Peer victimization is a common social stressor
associated with significant social and
emotional costs for youth, such as
depression. However, little is known about
how victimization leads to depression or why
some victimized youth may be more
vulnerable to depression than others. We
hypothesized that chronic victimization may
either be associated with maladaptive
neural processing of social and emotional
cues, thereby conferring risk for depression
(i.e., mediation) or heighten the association
between victimization and depression (i.e.,
moderation). A unique sample of 44 female
adolescents was recruited from a
longitudinal study that assessed youth
annually from the 2nd – 8th grade. Two
groups were composed of girls with chronic
victimization exposure or non–exposure

based on self-reported victimization from
2nd-8th grade. In 9th grade, adolescents
completed self-report measures of
depressive symptoms and completed an
emotional processing task (Lieberman et al.,
2007) during an fMRI scan. Participants were
presented pictures of emotional faces and
either passively observed or matched the
faces to an emotion label. Preliminary results
suggest that victimized girls report
significantly higher levels of depression than
non-victimized girls. At the neural level,
chronically victimized girls exhibit altered
neural reactivity in affective brain regions
during emotional processing, as well as
altered functional connectivity between
affective (amygdala) and regulatory (PFC)
regions. This altered functional connectivity is
correlated with depression only in the
victimized group but not non-victimized
group, and might indicate poor regulatory
processing for chronically victimized females.
Additional analyses will test whether altered
neural reactivity and regulation mediate
group differences in depression.

EARLY SOCIAL DEPRIVATION ALTERS

stress can profoundly influence fear behavior
in childhood and beyond. As members of an
altricial species, there is perhaps no early life
stressor more disruptive for humans than
maternal deprivation, which has been shown
to accelerate amygdala development and
associated fear learning in rodents following
maternal deprivation. However, it has yet to
be demonstrated how maternal deprivation
alters amygdala-prefrontal dynamics that
support fear learning in humans, who
typically remain dependent on caregivers
longer than any other species. To address this
issue, we compared 48 previously
institutionalized (PI) youth (34F/14M; 6-16
years) to 55 comparison youth who had
never experienced institutional care
(29F/26M; 6-16 years). To assess amygdala-

!
prefrontal circuitry associated with fear
learning, participants completed a
conditioning paradigm while undergoing
functional neuroimaging wherein visual cues
were paired with either a neutral or aversive
tone (CS- and CS+, respectively). Both PI and
comparison youth showed robust behavioral
evidence of fear learning that was
supported by CS+ > CS- discrimination in the
basolateral amygdala. However, compared
to same-aged controls, PI children showed
greater CS+ > CS- discrimination in the
centromedial nucleus of the amygdala and
more adult-like prefrontal-amygdala
functional coupling. These data build on
existing evidence showing adult-like
prefrontal-amygdala coupling in youth
following maternal deprivation and are
suggestive of ontogenetic acceleration of
fear learning circuitry following maternal
deprivation.

ADAPTIVE ELABORATION: INDIVIDUAL
DIFFERENCES IN THE PROCESSING OF
NEGATIVE EMOTIONAL INFORMATION
PREDICT RESILIENCE!Sara J. Sagui -

Sean A. Dawson - University of North Carolina
at Charlotte; Sara M. Levens - University of
North Carolina at Charlotte – Attention to
negative emotional information has been
linked with rumination and depression, yet
little is known about how attention to
affective content relates to resiliency. The
present study sought to investigate how the
degree of attention capture for negative
emotional expressions varies by trait
resilience. Participants (N=69, mean age 19.3
years old, 85% female) completed an
affective priming task where facial
expressions of sad, angry, disgust, and
neutral emotions were presented first as
Primes (for 500ms) and then as Targets.
Reaction time (RT) to identify the target’s
emotional expression was assessed as a
function of the primes. Prime effects were
calculated by subtracting the RT for an
emotion target that followed the same
emotional prime from the average RT for an
emotional target that followed a neutral
prime. Larger priming scores indicate
emotion facilitation and less attention
capture of an emotion-congruent prime
compared to a neutral prime. The Ego
Resiliency Scale (ER89) was used to measure
trait resilience. Hierarchical regression

analyses controlling for age, gender, and
current depressive symptoms revealed that
only the sad priming score was a unique
significant predictor of resilience (β=.34,
p<.01). Specifically, individuals who had less
attention capture and elaborative
processing of initially presented sad stimuli
exhibited higher levels of resilience. These
results suggest that the tendency to process
rapidly presented sad content less
elaborately is adaptive. More broadly, less
attention to negative content may facilitate
appropriate emotion regulation and
responding, promoting less negative
emotional engagement during difficult
experiences.

Normal University – Male and female have
different typical responses to stress, i.e. fightor-flight for male and tend-and-befriend for
female. When faced with stress or threat,
male tend to exhibit more unbowed
responses than female. The present
functional MRI study aimed to explore the
gender difference during the fairness-related
decision-making processes in the social
stressful situation. Eighteen women and
eighteen men were scanned while they
were playing an adapted version of the
Ultimatum Game (UG) as responders. In the
control condition, the participant played one
on one with the proposer. In the stressful
condition, the participant also played with
the proposer, but she/he was informed that
the proposer had three friends who
supported any division schema given by the
proposer. Results revealed that, men
rejected more often and reported less
fairness ratings compared to women in the
stressful condition. At the neural level, we
found clusters located in bilateral anterior
insula, brain regions observed robustly in prior
studies adopting UG paradigm, were
activated more strongly when rejecting
relative to accepting unfair division schemas
in the stressful compared to the control
condition for men, but not for women. These

BIOLOGICAL MOTION PERCEPTION IN
CHILDREN WITH DEVELOPMENTAL BRAIN
DYSFUNCTION (DBD) & THEIR PARENTS!

Antoinette Sabatino - Geisinger- Autism and
Developmental Medicine Institute (ADMI);
David W. Evans - Geisinger- Autism and
Developmental Medicine Institute (ADMI);
Vanessa Troiani - Geisinger- Autism and
Developmental Medicine Institute (ADMI) –
Humans rely on visual information to perceive
and identify the actions of others. From early
on in development, infants preferentially
attend to displays of biological motion
(BioM), and deficiencies in these perceptual
abilities can serve as early predictors in
infants who eventually develop autism and
other DBDs. However, with experience,
rudimentary BioM perception develops into
higher order abilities of person identification
and action recognition. To date, little is
known regarding meaningful age-related
changes in the perception of BioM and
whether passive viewing of BioM stimuli
(typically used in infant research) can reflect
meaningful BioM attention across the
lifespan. Ten children (ages 3-13) with DBDs
and their biological parent participated.
Participants completed a passive visual task
including 6 second clips of point light displays
(PLDs) of BioM (a human walking) paired with
either object motion (a spinning top) or
random motion. Dependent variables were
metrics of gaze duration and latency to first
fixate at the PLD of BioM collected via a Tobii
eyetracker. Children spent less time looking
and were slower to fixate to PLDs of BioM
(p’s<.01). Children’s age was directly related
to gaze duration to BioM and indirectly
related to latency to fixate on BioM. Latency
to fixate on BioM was also related to total
scores on a quantitative measure of
psychotic traits observed in DBDs. Data
collection is ongoing. By comparing
eyetracking measures of children and
parents, we will demonstrate age related
changes in the perception of BioM across
development that may also be influenced
by genetic factors.

Developmental Medicine Institute (ADMI) –
Eyetracking research reveals that individuals
with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) display
an attentional bias towards nonsocial images
linked to common categories of
circumscribed interests (CI). CI, perseverative
attention and reduced visual exploration
have been observed in ASD and other
developmental brain disorders (DBDs) as well
as in typical development, suggesting these
behaviors may be best described as a
dimensional construct. Fifteen children (2-13
years of age) referred to a
neurodevelopmental disorders clinic for
developmental concerns, DBDs, and genetic
syndromes (e.g., ASD, ADHD, language
disorder, 16p11.2 deletion) and a biological
parent participated. Participants completed
a passive visual search task including
complex arrays of social and nonsocial
images linked to CI (e.g., trains, computers,
electronics) and other everyday items (e.g.,
clothing, dishes, furniture). Dependent
variables were metrics of gaze duration and
individual fixations collected via a Tobii
eyetracker. Results indicate children looked
longer and with greater detail at CI images
relative to images of everyday objects
(ps<.001). Children looked longer and with
greater detail at social images paired with
everyday objects versus CI images (ps<.01).
Children’s age was related to the number of
individual fixations to social images. A
parent-child intraclass correlation for gaze
duration to CI images approached
significance (ICC(14)=0.59,p<.06). Data
collection is ongoing. Relationships between
additional eyetracking metrics and symptom
measures of repetitive behaviors and
restricted interests will be explored. By
comparing eyetracking measures of children
and parents, we will demonstrate how
observed differences are indicative of a
behavioral phenotype that is continuously
distributed and influenced by genetic
factors.

ONE SIZE DOES NOT FIT ALL:
METHODOLOGICAL ISSUES IN
MEASURING THE FEEDBACK-RELATED

75

!
NEGATIVITY (FRN) IN ADOLESCENTS AND
ADULTS!Shawn E. Fagan - The Graduate

Center of The City University of New York; Jill
Grose-Fifer - John Jay College of Criminal
Justice of The City University of New York; The
Graduate Center of The City University of
New York – The feedback-related negativity
(FRN) is an ERP component that has been
used to investigate the neural correlates of
feedback processing. We and other labs
have shown that the FRN is still developing
during adolescence. However, there is a
good deal of variability across studies in how
the FRN is measured in terms of both filtering
and measurement criteria. In the present
study, we reanalyzed our existing data from
adults and adolescents (n=77), which was
recorded while they performed a simple
gambling task with unpredictable monetary
gains and losses of high and low magnitude.
We compared the effects of varying the high
pass filter and artifact reject criteria on the
amplitude of the FRN. Additionally, we
compared results using three different
methods of measuring the FRN: a peak-topeak measure, a mean area amplitude
measure over a narrow window around the
most negative peak, and a difference wave.
Our results show that main effects of
magnitude, valence, and age are largely
preserved across analyses; however, twoand three-way interactions varied
depending on filtering and measurement
criteria. The latency of the FRN varied
considerably more in adolescents compared
to adults; also, adolescent data was more
susceptible to artifacts, such as movement.
We argue that although some ERP analytical
techniques may be well-suited to process
adult data, they are not sensitive enough to
detect more subtle developmental
relationships between age and gender.

READ MY EXPRESSION: ATTENTIONAL
CAPTURE OF ANGRY STIMULI INTERACTS
WITH GENDER TO PREDICT INSECURE
ATTACHMENT STYLE!Kelsey L. Wolf -

University of North Carolina at Charlotte;
Samantha M. Tracy - University of North
Carolina at Charlotte; Sara J. Sagui University of North Carolina at Charlotte; Sara
M. Levens - University of North Carolina at
Charlotte – Biases in processing negative
content have been linked with insecure
attachment style. Critically, studies
investigating emotion attention capture

have not investigated the impact of gender,
despite the fact that insecure attachment
style presents differently for males and
females. The goal of the present study was
to investigate if attention capture for
negative emotional content varies by
gender to predict insecure attachment.
Participants (N=250, 72% female) completed
an affective priming task where sad, angry,
disgust, and neutral facial expressions were
presented first as Primes (for 500ms) and then
as Targets. Reaction time (RT) to identify the
target’s valence (positive or negative) was
assessed as a function of the primes. Prime
effects were calculated by subtracting the
RT to an emotion target with the same
emotional expression prime from the
average RT for an emotional target with a
neutral prime. Larger priming scores indicate
less attention capture of the emotion prime,
whereas smaller priming scores indicate
greater attention capture of the emotion
prime. Hierarchical regressions revealed that
gender significantly interacts with angry
priming scores to predict insecure
attachment style. In females, less attention
capture of angry primes predicted greater
avoidant attachment (β=.16, p<.05), while in
males, less attention capture of angry primes
predicted less avoidant attachment (β=-.34,
p<.01). Results indicate that greater attention
capture of angry stimuli is advantageous for
females, whereas less attention capture of
angry stimuli is advantageous for males.
Broadly, this suggests that gender differences
in emotional reactivity may influence the
way attachment style is developed and
maintained.

REDUCED COGNITIVE INTERFERENCE BY
TEMPORAL UNCERTAINTY IN
ADOLESCENCE!Alexandra M. Rodman -

Harvard University; Catherine Insel - Harvard
University; Alea C. Skwara - Harvard
University; Erik K. Kastman - Harvard University;
Stephanie F. Sasse - Harvard University; Leah
H. Somerville - Harvard University – In the face
of unpredictable versus predictable cues,
our group has previously shown that
temporal uncertainty slows cognitive
performance in healthy adults. The current
study aimed to test whether children,
adolescents, and adults are differentially
impacted by temporal uncertainty, as
measured by cognitive performance and
activity of brain systems critical to detecting
and resolving uncertainty. N=109 healthy

76

!
participants aged 9-22 completed an fMRI
task that involved making judgments about
negative and neutral pictures preceded by
either predictable temporal cues, which
showed participants a chronological
countdown, or unpredictable temporal cues
that were entirely random. Consistent with
our prior work, reaction times were
significantly more slowed to images following
unpredictable cues as compared to
predictable cues, which suggests that
temporal uncertainty leads to cognitive
interference. However, findings indicated
that the slowing effect of unpredictability vs.
predictability varied significantly by age.
With increasing age, participants resisted
slowing by uncertainty. In addition, a
quadratic age analysis showed that
adolescents exhibited less uncertainty-based
interference than both children and adults.
To explore the neurodevelopmental changes
that could contribute to this behavioral
effect, we examined the relationship
between task performance and neural
activation in the amygdala. Adolescents
showed an overall blunting of amygdala
activation compared to children and adults.
Moreover, the magnitude of amygdala
response to unpredictable vs. predictable
images correlated with behavioral slowing,
such that individuals with reduced amygdala
responses to unpredictable images showed
less reaction time slowing in their task
performance. These brain-behavior linkages
implicate amygdala-based neural systems in
uncertainty-related interference processes,
and the sensitivity of these systems are
dynamically shaped by development. These
findings are in line with the theoretical
framework of nonlinear neurodevelopmental
change in adolescents. Critically, these
findings implicate corresponding nonlinear
shifts in the neural activity of amygdalabased systems as one potential mechanism
for adolescent tolerance of temporal
uncertainty. Given that adolescence is an
important developmental period for
establishing independence and increased
explorative behavior, it may be adaptive for
adolescents to be less perturbed by
unexpected cues from the environment.

ATTENUATION OF PHYSIOLOGICAL
AROUSAL TO UNCERTAINTY DURING THE
ADOLESCENT TRANSITION!Maheen

Shermohammed - Harvard University; Alea C.
Skwara - Harvard University; C. E. Chiemeka

Ezie - Harvard University; Arielle G. Rabinowitz
- Harvard University; Leah H. Somerville Harvard University – Unpredictability is a
feature of the environment that has inherent
anxiogenic properties, and the intolerance
to uncertainty is highly related to clinical
anxiety in adults. This perspective would
suggest that adolescence, a period in
development characterized by the
emergence of anxiety disorders, may also be
a period of heightened sensitivity to
uncertainty. On the other hand, the
adolescent transition is associated with
intensified novelty-seeking and an increased
tolerance to ambiguity in economic
decision-making. We sought to shed light on
these competing hypotheses by directly
assessing developmental changes in
physiological arousal to temporal uncertainty
from late childhood to early adulthood. In
the current study, N=90, healthy participants
aged 9-22 viewed negative and neutral
pictures preceded by either predictable
temporal cues which showed participants a
“countdown” that accurately conveyed
how many seconds would elapse before a
picture appeared, or unpredictable
temporal cues that were entirely random.
Electrodermal response was continuously
recorded from the fingertips as an objective
measure of sympathetic autonomic nervous
system arousal. Analyses tested whether
electrodermal activity during temporal
uncertainty relative to certainty differed as a
function of participant age. Group analyses
focused on three distinct age trends: a linear
pattern of developmental change, a
quadratic pattern (adolescent-peaking)
developmental change, and an adolescentemergent pattern of developmental change
indicating rapid emergence from childhood
into adolescence. Results indicated a
significant interaction between predictability
and the adolescent-emergent age trend.
Whereas children and pre-adolescents
showed greater physiological arousal to
unpredictable relative to predictable
contexts, this pattern sharply attenuated into
mid-to-late adolescence. These findings
suggest that uncertainty becomes less
physiologically evocative during
adolescence, and supports broader
conceptions of adolescence as a period of
increased tolerance of uncertainty.

Cornell Medical College – For most legal
purposes, an individual is considered an
adult at the age of eighteen; but sometimes,
that age boundary shifts. For example,
individuals under age twenty-one are minors
for purposes of consenting to government
regulated research. Variations in the
definition of “adult” exist in many legal and
social policies. These distinctions between
juvenile and adult often are based on
political considerations and conventional
wisdom rather than empirical evidence.
Although developmental neuroscience
research has shown that the brain continues
to develop into the early twenties,
behavioral and neural distinctions between
adolescents and adults continue to be
delineated, particularly in the eighteen to
twenty-one age range. The present study
implements a novel behavioral paradigm,
together with psychophysiology and fMRI, to
examine impulsivity under transient and
sustained states of positive and negative
emotion in 87 individuals. We show that 13 to
21 year olds show similarly elevated
impulsivity as compared to adults over the
age of twenty one in response to transient
positive and negative emotional cues as well
as when under sustained states of positive
emotions. Dynamic developmental changes
in a network of ventrolatral prefrontal,
orbitofrontal, and subcortical regions parallel
these changes in behavior with age. No
significant differences in impulsivity were
observed across ages in neutral conditions.
Our findings suggest that, under emotional
arousal, 18 to 21 year olds may behave more
similarly to younger adolescents than to older
adults. These results may have implications
for legal and social policies and judgments
of criminal responsibility with respect to
young adults.

NORMATIVE DEVELOPMENT OF VENTRAL
STRIATAL RESTING-STATE CONNECTIVITY
IN HUMANS!Dominic S. Fareri - Columbia

University; Bonnie Goff - University of
California, Los Angeles; Jessica Flannery University of Oregon; Dylan G. Gee - Weill
Cornell Medical College; Daniel S. Lumian University of Denver; Christina Caldera University of California, Los Angeles; Nim
Tottenham - Columbia University – Incentives
guide behavior throughout our lives, perhaps
most importantly during the early years of life.
The ventral striatum (VS) is a critical piece of
an incentive valuation circuit, sharing
afferent and efferent anatomical
connections with subcortical and cortical
structures additionally supporting incentive
valuation (Haber and Knutson, 2010). Restingstate functional connectivity (rsFC) is a
powerful, task-free method with which to
track the development of functional neural
organization. rsFC may reflect maintenance
of relationships between regions supporting
related processes (Vincent and Buckner,
2007). We employed a seed-based analysis
to investigate VS rsFC development in a
cross-sectional sample of typically
developing individuals aged 4-23 years old
(n=66). We probed changes in VS rsFC with
targeted regions supporting incentive
valuation––amygdala, hippocampus and
mPFC. Strong positive VS-amygdala
connectivity emerged in childhood;
however, VS-hippocampal rsFC emerged
only in adulthood, consistent with studies
showing hippocampal recruitment in
incentive-based processes in adults (Foerde
and Shohamy, 2011). Specific mPFC regions
(subgenual ACC; sgACC) exhibited robust
positive connectivity with the VS in
childhood, which significantly declined with
age. Given associations between
testosterone, VS function in adolescence (Op
de Macks et al., 2011) and ACC structural
development (Koolschijn et al., 2014), we
examined changes in testosterone levels as a
mechanism underlying VS rsFC development.
Testosterone significantly mediated agerelated decreases in VS-sgACC rsFC. Our
findings suggest normative VS rsFC
development is dynamic, characterized by
early establishment of connectivity with
mPFC and limbic structures supporting
incentive valuation, and substantial
functional reorganization with later

ADOLESCENT AMYGDALA RESPONSE
LINKED WITH ATTACHMENT SECURITY TO
PARENTS!Sarah Stoycos - University of

Southern California; Larissa Del Piero University of Southern California; Darby Saxbe
- University of Southern California – The
amygdala has been implicated in response
to emotionally salient information and as
playing a role in attachment to parents
(Lemche et al., 2006). Specifically, Tottenham
et al., (2012) found that children and
adolescents exhibited increased amygdala
activation in response to photos of their
mothers rather than strangers. The current
study used an ecologically valid paradigm to
investigate adolescent neural response to
parents in association to attachment
security. Twenty-one adolescents (Mean age
= 16.9 years) were shown emotional video
clips of their parents and asked to rate the
valence of the clips while undergoing
functional neuroimaging. The video stimuli
were collected during an earlier laboratory
visit as part of the ongoing longitudinal study
from which the adolescents and their parents
were recruited. Self reported attachment
was measured using the Inventory of Parent
and Peer Attachment—Revised (Armsden &
Greenberg, 1987). The magnitude of the
bilateral amygdala percent signal changes
(in comparison to baseline) were significantly
positively correlated with attachment
security to parents (right amygdala: r(19) =
.49, p = .03; left amygdala: r(19) = .45, p =
.05). Percent signal change in the ventral
striatum compared to baseline was
marginally associated with attachment
security to parents, r(19) = .42, p = .08. These
results support prior literature highlighting the
role of the amygdala and ventral striatum in
attachment salience for adolescents. In
conclusion, the more adolescents feel they
can securely rely on their parents, the more
active their bilateral amygdalae are in
response to videos of their parents.

NEURAL CORRELATES OF THE PROPENSITY
FOR RETALIATORY BEHAVIOR IN YOUTH AT
RISK FOR REACTIVE AGGRESSION!Stuart F.

Michelle Ventieghem - Columbia University;

Sarah J. Brislin - Florida State University; Isaiah
Sypher - National Institute of Mental Health;
Soonjo Hwang - National Institute of Mental
Health; James R. Blair - National Institute of
Mental Health – Good animal models of
physical reactive aggression exist, but the
social aspects of human aggression,
including retaliatory propensity during social
provocation, are poorly understood.
Retaliatory propensity, assessed with the
Ultimatum Game, has been associated with
increased activation in both threat
(amygdala, PAG) and decision-making
circuitry (ventromedial prefrontal cortex
[vmPFC], dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
[dlPFC], dorsomedial frontal cortex [dmFC],
anterior insula cortex [AIC]). Differing risk
between individuals for reactive aggression is
poorly understood. To address this, this study
investigated youth with Disruptive Behavior
Disorders (DBD; Conduct Disorder,
Oppositional Defiant Disorder) with high
[DBD+CU] and low [DBD-CU] levels of
callous-unemotional traits, who show
increased risk for reactive aggression, but
distinct neural correlates in threat response
and decision-making circuitries. Retaliatory
propensity was assessed in 30 DBD youth and
26 healthy youth using a variant of the
Ultimatum Game during fMRI. DBD youth
showed increased retaliatory propensity that
was positively associated with reactive
aggression. Furthermore, youth with DBD-CU,
but not DBD+CU, showed increased
responding in threat circuitry (amygdala,
PAG). Youth with DBD showed increased
responding in dlPFC decreased functional
connectivity between amygdala/PAG and
vmPFC, left dlPFC and dmFC relative to
healthy youth. DBD-CU showed increased
threat response to social provocation
consistent with hostile attribution bias models
of reactive aggression. However, all DBD
youth showed dysfunction in decisionmaking regions and connectivity between
threat and decision-making circuitries. The
role of decision-making in response to social
provocation will require further investigation.

AFFECTIVE REACTIVITY AND REGULATION
ACROSS ADOLESCENCE: NEURAL
RESPONSES TO DYNAMIC PEER EMOTIONS!
Jessica E. Flannery - University of Oregon;
Nicole R. Giuliani - University of Oregon; John
C. Flournoy - University of Oregon; Jennifer H.
Pfeifer - University of Oregon – Adolescence
is characterized by physiological,

79

!
neurological and social changes. The field
currently conceptualizes these
neurobiological changes and associated
social sequelae in terms of an imbalance
between systems supporting reactivity and
regulation, as well as expects nonlinear
patterns of neural reactivity (peaking in
adolescence) and linear improvements in
neural indices of regulation. Previous
research suggests that during emotion
labeling or reappraisal, LPFC and MPFC
responses increase, and responses in
amygdala and mOFC decrease, relative to
passive viewing of affective stimuli. However,
past work in this area has relied heavily on
paradigms using static, adult faces.
The current fMRI study (N=60 neurotypical
female youth, evenly distributed between 1022 years of age) utilized a dynamic peer
affect-labeling paradigm. Main effects of
Label were observed in bilateral LPFC,
bilateral amygdala, and mOFC. Main effects
of View were observed in bilateral amygdala
and mOFC. Although these effects were
quite robust, direct comparisons between
conditions revealed that Label recruited
bilateral LPFC significantly more than View;
meanwhile, View recruited mOFC
significantly more than Label. Interestingly,
however, there was a significant nonlinear
(quadratic) pattern of lateral PFC
recruitment during Label, reaching a nadir
during mid-adolescence; and a significant
linear decrease with age in mOFC during
View. These findings differ from predictions
typically made by common neurobiological
models of adolescent development, and
highlight the importance of social context in
our understanding of adolescent emotion
processing. Furthermore, these data allow us
to investigate the differential influence of
basic versus complex emotions across age.

research suggests that early adverse
caregiving alters the developmental
trajectory of amygdala-prefrontal circuitry,
resulting in heightened emotional reactivity
and adult-like fear learning. This research has
focused primarily on the function of this
circuit when processing facial expressions of
clear valance, such as those of fear and
happiness. However, adult studies have
shown that facial expressions with ambiguous
affect (i.e., surprised) can elucidate trait-like
emotional biases that are associated with
amygdala-mPFC circuitry. Further, typically
developing children show a negative bias to
surprise faces that declines with age. The
current study examined the effects of early
adversity on emotional appraisals of surprised
faces in a sample of previously
institutionalized (PI) youth and comparisons
between the ages of 6-14 (N=167, mean
age=9.8, M=65). Participants viewed a
standardized set of surprised, happy, and
angry faces and rated whether each face
“felt good or felt bad” as quickly as possible.
Resting-state fMRI scans were acquired for a
subset of participants to examine the
functional integrity of amygdala-mPFC
circuitry. PI youth showed more positive (i.e.
adult-like) appraisal of surprised faces
relative to comparisons (p<0.05). Preliminary
findings suggest that stronger (i.e. more
mature) amygdala-mPFC connectivity was
associated with more positive appraisal of
surprised faces across both groups (p<0.05).
Although PI youth showed elevated levels of
social anxiety at the group level, those
individuals with more positive appraisals
showed lower levels of social anxiety
(p<0.01). These findings suggest that more
positive appraisal of ambiguous emotional
cues may reflect an ontogenetic adaptation
following early adversity.

Lancaster University; Ermanno Quadrelli Milano-Bicocca University; Emanuela Croci Milano-Bicocca University; Chiara Turati Milano-Bicocca University – Although
emotional mimicry has been proposed as an
important mechanism of affect sharing and
empathy (Hoffman, 2000), there is little to no
evidence showing its presence in infants and
preschool children (Jones, 2009). In this study
we investigated 3-year-olds’ facial mimicry
responses to facial and bodily expressions of

80

!
emotions by using electromyography (EMG).
Three-year-olds (N=18) were presented with
static images (500ms) of female faces and
bodies expressing happiness, anger, fear,
and neutral emotions. EMG was recorded
from zygomaticus major (specific for happy
facial expressions) and frontalis (activated in
angry and fearful facial expressions) muscles.
A 2(Condition) x 2(Muscle) x 4(Emotion)
ANOVA for the average activation (800-1200
ms from stimulus onset) showed a marginally
significant interaction muscle-emotion
(F(3,51) = 2.775, p = .051) and a significant
interaction condition-muscle-emotion
(F(3,51) = 2.938, p = .042). For faces, but not
for bodies, a significant interaction muscleemotion was revealed (F(3,51) = 4.484, p =
.007). The zygomaticus activation was higher
for happy compared to angry (t(17) = 2.994;
p = .004) and fearful faces (t(17) = 2.904; p =
.005), while the frontalis activation was higher
for angry compared to happy faces (t(17) = 1.762; p = .048). This pattern of results
suggests emotionally congruent muscle
activation in response to other’s facial
expressions. The findings will be discussed
with respect to the use of facial EMG as a
measure for emotional mimicry in preschoolers and infants, and their implications
for investigating early empathy
development.

BY THE SOUND IT. AN ERP INVESTIGATION
OF INFANT PROCESSING OF HUMAN
ACTION SOUNDS.!Elena Geangu -

Lancaster University; Ermanno Quadrelli Milano-Bicocca University; James Lewis West Virginia University; Viola Macchi Cassia Milano-Bicocca University; Chiara Turati Milano-Bicocca University – Recent evidence
suggests that adults perceive human action
(HA) sounds as a distinct category from
human vocalizations (HV), environmental
(ENV), and mechanical (MEC) sounds,
activating different neural networks (Lewis et
al., 2011). However, little is known about
when such specialization develops. Infants
show a relative fast specialization for
processing voices (Blasi et al., 2011; Nazzi et
al., 1998), but it is unknown whether this
ability extends to human actions sounds as
well. Our study aimed to investigate whether
7-month-olds process HA sounds as a distinct
category compared to HV, ENV, and MEC
sounds. Infants were randomly presented
with 1000ms auditory recordings specific to
each category, while continuous EEG was

recorded (500Hz) with a high density system
(Geodesic Sensor Nets, EGI). Event-related
potentials (ERPs) time-locked to the stimulus
onset were further analysed. Results show
that HA lead to increased positive amplitude
compared to the other categories at anterior
left temporal locations (470-570ms) (F(3, 42) =
4.65; p = .016). Human sounds (HA + HV) lead
to larger amplitudes compared to nonhuman sounds (EN + ME) at parietal (550650ms) (F(3, 42) = 3.40; p = .026) and frontal
locations (550-750ms) (F(3, 42) = 6.79; p =
.001) across both hemispheres. HV lead to
increased negative amplitude at posterior
temporal electrodes (470-570 ms) (F(3, 42) =
5.22; p = .004). The current study suggests
that 7-month-old infants process HA sounds
as a distinct auditory category. Results are
discussed in terms of their implications for our
understanding of infant action processing
development.

THE NEURAL CORRELATES OF SOCIAL
COMPARISONS: DIFFERENTIAL
ACTIVATIONS FOR SELF-RELATED
COMPARISONS!Gayannee Kedia -

University of Graz; Thomas Mussweiler University of Cologne; Ruth Adams - Klinikum
der Universitaet Muenchen; David Linden Cardiff University – Humans have a drive to
compare themselves to others and this
tendency determines how they perceive
themselves and others, how they feel about
their achievements and failures and make
decisions in social context. Social
comparison constitutes a fundamental social
cognitive process but to now its neural
substrates remain unknown. Previous
research has demonstrated that the
comparison of two external persons activate
a frontoparietal network associated with
numbers and simple nonsocial magnitudes.
The closer two magnitudes the slower the
comparison and the stronger the activation
of this network. In the present fMRI study we
investigated whether self-involving
comparisons also rely on this comparative
frontoparietal network or whether they rather
engage specific neuroanatomical
correlates. To that end, we asked female
participants to compare their own
attractiveness or the attractiveness of a
female familiar other to a series of unknown
women whose pictures were sequentially
displayed on the scanner projection screen.
Behaviorally, we observed a distance effect

81

!
for both Self-Other and Other-Other
comparisons. In both conditions, participants
were slower for comparisons with targets
whose attractiveness was similar to their own
(or their familiar others). At the neural level,
this distance effect came with the activation
of frontal regions previously associated with
person and magnitude comparisons (i.e. the
DLPFC and dACC). Interaction contrasts,
however, also revealed a more pronounced
effect of distance for Self-Other comparisons
in the anterior insula, a structure known for its
role in self-relevant information processing.
Taken together, these results suggest that
comparisons involving the self engage
specific brain regions.

A NEURAL CODE ABOUT THE PERSONALITY
OF THE SELF, CLOSE AND UNFAMILIAR
OTHERS IS REPRESENTED IN THE MEDIAL
PREFRONTAL CORTEX!Frank Van Overwalle

- Vrije Universiteit Brussel; Elien Heleven - Vrije
Universiteit Brussel – The medial Prefrontal
Cortex (mPFC) is involved in inferences about
the personality traits of the self and others.
We investigated whether the mPFC also
represents the neural memory code for
persons that possess these traits, as this code
might by critical for normal social interaction.
To localize these codes, we used fMRI
repetition suppression, which is a rapid
suppression of fMRI responses upon repeated
presentation of the same stimulus, in this
case, the person as he or she is (i.e., with a
set of traits). Participants had to infer a
person’s traits from brief trait-implying
behavioral descriptions. In each trial, the
critical (target) sentence was preceded by a
sentence (prime) that implied the same
person or not. Experiment 1 demonstrated
that a neural code of close others (family
and friends) is located in the mPFC.
Experiment 2 showed that a code of
unfamiliar others (with Star Trek-like names) is
located in the anterior intraparietal sulcus,
and also in the mPFC although its exact
location differed between participants. This
may indicate that the mPFC serves as a
varying and temporary placeholder to code
unfamiliar persons. Experiment 3 revealed
that a neural code about the self is located
in the mPFC and precuneus. Furthermore,
activation in the mPFC (for close others and
the self) is correlated with the size of the
participants’ social network. Together, these
person codes provide us with an atlas of

brain areas which contain critical memory on
(the personality of) the self and others.

NEURAL REPRESENTATIONS OF FAMILIAR
PEOPLE AND SITUATIONS!Sara C. Verosky -

Oberlin College; Jason P. Mitchell - Harvard
University – Thinking about the self and others
involves a network of regions that includes
the medial prefrontal, posterior cingulate,
and lateral inferior parietal cortices.
Interestingly, many of these same regions
tend to show decreased activity during most
goal-directed tasks, and only show increased
activity under conditions that foster internally
directed thought. While we know these
regions are sensitive to social dimensions
such as the similarity between others and the
self, little is known about specific content
represented in them. The current study used
functional magnetic resonance imaging
(fMRI) and multivoxel pattern analysis (MVPA)
to examine representations of familiar
people. While in the scanner, participants
indicated how much they and four familiar
others would enjoy being in various situations.
Participants answered ten questions about
each of six types of situation; for example,
how much they would enjoy reading comic
books, novels, and People magazine.
Unique patterns of activity in medial
prefrontal cortex and posterior cingulate
cortex were associated with thinking about
different familiar people. We also discovered
unique patterns of activity in those same
regions, as well as in bilateral parietal regions,
for thinking about different situations.
Together, our findings demonstrate that
social brain regions overlapping with the
default network carry information about
people and situations, both of which are
important for simulating events removed
from the present.

NEURAL DISSOCIATIONS BETWEEN
MEANINGFUL AND MERE
INCONSISTENCIES DURING IMPRESSION
UPDATING!Peter Mende-Siedlecki - New

York University; Alexander Todorov Princeton University – We rapidly form
impressions of other people, but these initial
impressions are often incomplete and must
be updated in light of inconsistent
information. While recent work has begun to
characterize the neural bases of impression
updating, the functional contributions of

82

!
these regions to the updating process remain
unclear. Using fMRI, we tested whether
increases in activity in the updating network
reflect changes in the stored representations
of other people in response to behavioral
inconsistency, or merely a response to the
inconsistency itself. Participants encountered
a series of individuals whose behavior was
either “meaningfully” inconsistent (switching
from either moral to immoral or immoral to
moral) or “merely” inconsistent (switching in
a surprising, but not trait-relevant manner).
Left vlPFC and left IFG responded
preferentially to “meaningful”
inconsistency—specifically when behaviors
changed in character from moral to
immoral, consistent with prior work. However,
bilateral TPJ, dorsal ACC, and PCC
responded preferentially when behavior
changed in a “merely” inconsistent fashion.
Furthermore, we began to assess the
behavioral consequences of individual
differences in updating. Combining across
three neuroimaging investigations impression
updating, we examined the degree to which
activity in key nodes of the updating network
might underscore individual differences
related to updating. We observed that
individuals who show stronger vlPFC activity
when updating based on negative
behaviors, as compared to positive
behaviors, scored lower on a composite
updating index (i.e., endorsed less flexible
views regarding personality and reported a
lower frequency of changing their minds
about other people in everyday life).

SOCIAL BUTTERFLY OR LONER?
INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES IN SOCIAL
INTEREST ARE REFLECTED IN SCALED
ACTIVATIONS OF ORBITOFRONTAL
CORTEX FACE-PATCHES!Vanessa Troiani -

Geisinger Autism & Developmental Medicine
Institute; Ingrid R. Olson - Temple University –
Humans are extraordinarily tuned to the
social world, driven to connect with other
humans from the earliest moments of life.
Social motivation engages intrinsic
motivational mechanisms to attend and
approach social stimuli. Individual
differences in social motivation may be
reflected in differential activations in brain
regions that support both social and reward
processing. A candidate neural region is
orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), a region broadly
implicated in value computations, with

activations reflecting scaled value responses
to objects (including money & food). OFC
also contains patches of face-sensitive cells,
which we speculate encode the social and
emotional value of conspecifics. We tested
the hypothesis that individual variation in
social motivation is linked to activation of
OFC face patches. Location and fMRI
response properties of OFC face-selective
patches were characterized in 20 healthy
adults. Results showed that medial OFC
(mOFC) responses were face-selective and
behaviorally relevant, as activation in this
region correlated inversely with social
interest/enjoyment as measured by the aloof
subscale of the broader autism phenotype
(BAP-Q). In contrast, the ventral striatum and
lateral OFC responded equally to faces and
food. Furthermore, differences in mOFC
activation across subjects were distinct from
face memory (Cambridge Face Memory
Test) responses in the fusiform, suggesting a
distinct function of mOFC in social
motivation, rather than perceptual aspects
of face processing. These findings suggest
that regions of the OFC are selective for
social stimuli and that the function of this
region in the extended face network is linked
to social motivation.

EFFECTS OF MOOD ON THE PROCESSING
OF EMOTIONAL STIMULI IN SELF-RELEVANT
AND NON-SELF-RELEVANT CONTEXTS!Eric
C. Fields - Tufts University, Massachusetts
General Hospital; Matthew O'Conor - Tufts
University; Erich Tusch - Brigham and
Women’s Hospital; Rohan Natraj - Tufts
University; Gina R. Kuperberg - Tufts University,
Massachusetts General Hospital – In previous
work (see Fields & Kuperberg, NeuroImage,
2012; Fields et al., SANS, 2012), we have
explored the processing of emotional words
in social context by recording event-related
potentials (ERP) while participants read twosentence social vignettes in second-person
(self-relevant) or third-person (other-relevant)
with a neutral, positive, or negative critical
word in the second sentence. For example:
"A man knocks on Sandra’s/your hotel room
door. She/you see(s) that he has a
*gift/tray/gun* in his hand." In the present
work, we explored the effects of mood on
the processing of these scenarios by
inducing either a positive or negative mood
in participants (between subjects) creating a
2 (Mood: positive, negative) x 2 (selfrelevance: self, other) x 3 (valence: neutral,

83

!
positive, negative) design. Results revealed a
different pattern effects across the two
mood conditions on the late positive
component (LPC) that is often evoked by
emotional stimuli. In the Happy condition, the
LPC was larger to positive and negative
words than to neutral words, but negative
and positive words did not differ. In the Sad
condition, the LPC to negative words was
larger than the LPC to positive or neutral
words, which did not differ from each other.
These effects, in turn, were stronger for the
self-relevant condition than the otherrelevant condition. Thus, it seems that
positive words may draw additional attention
and processing in a happy mood,
particularly for stimuli that are self-relevant.

INCREASED ATTENTION AND MEMORY
FOR BELOVED-RELATED INFORMATION
DURING INFATUATION: BEHAVIORAL AND
ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL DATA!Sandra

J.E. Langeslag - University of Missouri at St.
Louis; Jamie R. Olivier - Erasmus University
Rotterdam; Martine E. Köhlen - Erasmus
University Rotterdam; Ilse M. Nijs - Erasmus
University Rotterdam; Jan W. Van Strien Erasmus University Rotterdam – Emotionally
salient information is well attended and
remembered. It has been shown that
infatuated individuals have increased
attention for their beloved. It is unknown
whether this attention bias generalizes to
information related to the beloved.
Moreover, infatuated individuals report to
remember trivial things about their beloved,
but this has not yet been tested empirically.
In two studies, we tested whether infatuated
individuals have increased attention and
memory for beloved-related information. In a
passive viewing task (Study 1), the late
positive potential, an event-related potential
(ERP) component reflecting motivated
attention, was enhanced for belovedrelated vs friend-related words/phrases. In a
recognition task (Study 2), memory
performance and the frontal and parietal
ERP old/new effects, reflecting familiarity and
recollection, respectively, were not
enhanced for beloved-related compared
with friend-related words/phrases. In free
recall tasks in both studies, memory was
better for beloved-related than friendrelated words/phrases. This research reveals
that attention and memory are enhanced
for beloved-related information. These

attention and memory biases for belovedrelated information were not due to valence,
semantic relatedness, or experience, but to
arousal. To conclude, romantic love has
profound effects on cognition that play a
clear role in daily life.

SELF-ESTEEM AND AUTOBIOGRAPHICAL
MEMORY RECONSTRUTION!Rachel Amey -

University of Delaware; Chad Forbes University of Delaware; Jordan Leitner University of California, Berkley – Past
research highlights an intimate reciprocal
relationship between one’s self-concept and
their autobiographical memories. For
instance, the desire to increase or maintain a
positive sense of self is hypothesized to play
an important role in biasing autobiographical
memory reconstruction processes and vice
versa. However, the neurocognitive
mechanisms are still less understood. The
current research examined how self-esteem
biases neural processes associated with selforiented and basic perceptual processing to
affect memory for socially accepting or
rejecting individuals. Continuous EEG activity
was recorded while participants viewed
photos of individuals who were ostensibly
deciding to reject or accept the participant.
Following this task, participants were given a
surprise memory test for the faces presented
during the task (and foils). Self-esteem was
assessed post-task. Time–frequency analyses
conducted on neural activity elicited in
response to socially accepting and rejecting
faces revealed that individuals higher in selfesteem exhibited increased communication
(i.e., phase locking) between the Medial
Prefrontal Cortex (mPFC) and Right Superior
Temporal Sulcus (rSTS) in the theta band to
both accepting and rejecting faces and
subsequently remembered these faces
better as well. Conversely, those with lower
self-esteem had less accurate memory for
accepting and rejecting faces when phase
locking between these regions was high.
These findings suggest that self-esteem biases
autobiographical memory encoding
processes by influencing how the mPFC and
rSTS process social feedback and alludes to
intriguing relationships between selfperceptions and conceptualizations for
one’s social world.

SOCIAL COMPARISON MODULATES THE
NEURAL RESPONSE TO REGRET!Zhiyuan Liu -

East China Normal University; Lin Li - East
China Normal University; Li Zheng - East China
Normal University; Xiuyan Guo - East China
Normal University – The emotion of regret was
considered to be associated with the
counterfactual processing of aversive
outcomes and sensitive to various social
contexts. In the present functional magnetic
resonance imaging (fMRI) study, we
investigated how the social comparison
could modulate behavioral and brain
responses to the emotion of regret by
employing a modified sequential risk taking
task that induces the feeling of regret. In the
task, after participants decided to stop a
trial, not only the chosen option (collected
gain), but also the alternative option (missed
gain) was revealed in this trial. At the same
time, a pseudo-participant’s outcome was
showed for participants, too. Participants
were informed to compare self outcome
with pseudo-participant’s. They may
collected more gain than pseudoparticipant (positive social-comparative
feedback, PSC feedback), or collected less
gain than pseudo-participant (negative
social-comparative feedback, NSC
feedback). At the behavioral level,
participants rated less regret for the PSC
feedback compared with the NSC feedback
when encountered with aversive outcomes.
At the neural level, increased ventral striatum
and ACC activation were found in the PSC
feedback relative to the NSC feedback
when participants encountered with aversive
outcomes. These findings indicated the
modulation of social comparison in the
emotion of regret, i.e., even though met with
aversive outcomes, people might feel less
regret if they did better (collected more
gain) than others.

THINKING ABOUT SIMILAR OTHERS:
REGIONS SUPPORTING EVALUATION AND
MEMORY FOR OTHERS VARYING IN
SIMILARITY TO THE SELF!Eric D. Leshikar University of Illinois at Chicago; Brittany S.
Cassidy - Brandeis University, Indiana
University; Angela, H. Gutchess - Brandeis
University – Prior work suggests medial
prefrontal cortex (MPFC) involvement when
thinking about the self as well as similar
others. In this investigation, we examined

cortical regions responsive to thinking about
others varying in degrees of similarity to the
self (high, medium, low). Prior work has
found that ventral medial prefrontal cortex
(vMPFC) is active when thinking about similar
others. However, this work has predominantly
defined similarity on a single dimension (e.g.,
political orientation) and has not probed the
regions that support memory formation. In
this study, participants generated
positive/negative impressions for facebehavior pairs, employing a variety of
different traits, and then were tested on their
memory for the generated impressions. Using
a post-recognition rating, impression trials
(encoding) were back-sorted into high-,
medium-, and low-self-similarity. We
predicted that impression memory would be
best for those most similar to the self which
was confirmed by our behavioral results.
Turning to our fMRI data, we first identified
regions tracking similarity to the self. Dorsal
anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) activity
increased linearly with increasing similarity to
the self (high>medium>low), suggesting that
this region might code for how similar others
are to the self. We then investigated regions
supporting impression memory, finding a
dissociation within medial temporal lobe
regions. For others similar to the self, activity in
the amygdala supported memory, whereas
the hippocampus supported memory for
dissimilar others. This result implies a
prominent role for the amygdala in binding
socioemotional content that is particularly
relevant to the self.

THE INTERACTION OF MOTOR AND
SOMATOSENSORY SIMULATION: A
MOTOR-BASED SENSORY CONGRUENCY
PARADIGM.!Eliane Deschrijver - Ghent

University; Roeljan Wiersema - Ghent
University; Marcel Brass - Ghent University –
Research has suggested that when we
simulate an observed action, we do not only
motorically simulate the behavior but also
simulate the somatosensory consequences
of this action (e.g., Keysers, Kaas & Gazzola,
2010). In the current study, we investigated
the electrophysiology of somatosensory
simulation in action observation by means of
a new motor-based sensory congruency
paradigm and EEG. We presented index or
middle finger tapping movements of a
human or a wooden hand, while
simultaneously presenting ‘tap-like’ tactile

85

!
sensations to the either corresponding or
non-corresponding fingertip of the
participant. The results showed effects of
somatosensory simulation in the early
somatosensory evoked potentials P50 and an
animacy effect in the N100/N140.
Interestingly, we also observed a congruency
effect in the P3 for human hands only, with
non-corresponding observed hand

movements eliciting a smaller P3 than all
other conditions. We argue that the motorbased sensory congruency paradigm can
help understand higher order social
processes such as self-other distinction, by
signaling whenever simulated sensory
information does not match sensory
information coming from one’s own body.

SPONTANEOUS NEURAL ENCODING OF
SOCIAL DISTANCE!Carolyn M. Parkinson -

Dartmouth College; Adam M. Kleinbaum Tuck School of Business, Dartmouth College;
Thalia Wheatley - Dartmouth College –
Psychological distance–i.e., distance from
one’s first-hand experience in space, time,
social ties or hypotheticality-is thought to
comprise a fundamental aspect of meaning
that is processed automatically, even when
unrelated to the task at hand. Previously, we
demonstrated that social, temporal, and
spatial distances from oneself are
represented in a parsimonious neural code
when participants perform tasks involving
distance judgments. The current study sought
to test if psychological distance is
spontaneously encoded in naturalistic
contexts, and to identify the brain systems
involved. More specifically, we tested for the
automatic encoding of social distance,
which is thought to inform many facets of
everyday behavior, such as trust, empathy,
and cooperation. To do this, we combined
social network analysis with multivariate
pattern analysis of functional magnetic
resonance imaging data. After
reconstructing the social network of all
students in a large graduate program, a
subset of these individuals participated in a
neuroimaging study in which they passively
viewed individualized stimulus sets consisting
of short videos of classmates at varying
distances from themselves (e.g., friends,
friends-of-friends, other acquaintances) in
the social network of their graduate
program. Across participants, social distance
could be decoded from distributed patterns
of brain activity in the right inferior parietal
cortex. These results are consistent with
suggestions that psychological distance–in
particular, social distance–is a fundamental
aspect of meaning that is automatically
encoded, and that social relationship
knowledge–both about our direct social ties
and about relationships between third
parties–comprises an important component
of person perception.

NEUROANATOMICAL MARKERS OF
SOCIAL HIERARCHY RECOGNITION IN
HUMANS. A COMBINED ERP - MRI STUDY!

Hernando Santamaría - Pompeu Fabra
University; Miguel Burgaleta - Pompeu Fabra
University; Nuria Sebastian Galles - Pompeu
Fabra University – Social hierarchy is an
ubiquitous principle of social organization
across animal species. Although some
progress has been made to understand how
humans infer hierarchical identity, the
neuroanatomical basis for perceiving key
social dimensions of others remains
unexplored. Here, we combined Event
Related Potentials and structural Magnetic
Resonance Imaging to reveal the
neuroanatomical substrates of early status
recognition. We designed a covertly
simulated hierarchical setting where
participants performed a task either with a
superior or with an inferior player. Participants
showed higher amplitude in the N170
component when presented with a picture
of a superior player compared to an inferior
player. Crucially, the magnitude of this effect
correlated with brain morphology of the
posterior cingulate cortex, superior temporal
gyrus, insula, fusiform gyrus and caudate
nucleus. We conclude that early recognition
of social hierarchies relies on the structural
properties of a network involved in the
automatic recognition of social identity.

SOCIAL SUPERIORITY MODULATES
COGNITIVE ALTERATIONS IN OBSESSIVE
COMPULSIVE DISORDER!Hernando

Santamaría - Pompeu Fabra University;
Carles Soriano - Bellvitge Hospital; Miguel
Burgaleta - Pompeu Fabra University; Narcis
Cardoner - Bellvitge Hospital; Alba Ayneto Pompeu Fabra University; José Menchón Bellvitge Hospital; Nuria Sebastián - Pompeu
Fabra University – Objectives. Error
monitoring, cognitive control and motor
inhibition control are proposed as cognitive
alterations disrupted in obsessive-compulsive
disorder (OCD). Likewise, OCD is also
associated with an increased sensitivity to
social evaluations. Since experiencing a
social role can modulate an array of
cognitive functions, altered cognitive
functioning in OCD could be affected by the
social context. We examined the effect of a
social hierarchy simulation over

87

!
electrophysiological indices of cognitive
alterations in OCD.
Methods. A case-control cross-sectional
study measuring event-related potentials
(ERP) for error monitoring (Error-Related
Negativity), cognitive control (N2) and motor
control (LRP) was conducted. We analyzed
twenty OCD patients and twenty control
participants, matched for age, sex,
handedness and educational level. ERP were
recorded during a social game consisting of
a visual discrimination task, which was
performed in presence of a simulated
superior or an inferior player. Results.
Significant social effects (different ERP
amplitudes in Superior vs. Inferior player
conditions) were found for OCD patients, but
not for controls, in all ERP components.
Furthermore, performing the task against a
simulated inferior player reduced abnormal
ERP responses in OCD to those levels
observed in healthy controls. The hierarchyinduced ERP effects were accompanied by
hierarchical differences over reaction times
and intra-individual variability measures only
in OCD patients. Conclusions. Social context
modulates neuromarkers of abnormal
cognitive functioning in OCD. We conclude
that experiencing a social superiority position
reduced excessive error monitoring activity
and enhanced cognitive and motor control
mechanisms. These results open the door to
investigating new therapeutic choices.

DOMINANCE IN TARGET FACES PREDICTS
MOTOR RESONANCE!Nadya Styczynski -

Brandeis University; Yanyi Jiang - Brandeis
University; Simian Cai - Brandeis University;
Sara R. Pedersen - Brandeis University;
Jennifer N. Gutsell - Brandeis University –
Similar neural circuits are activated during
action and action observation, and such
motor resonance is believed to support
action understanding and interpersonal
coordination. Motor resonance, however,
has been shown to be biased by personal
and group characteristics of the target such
as familiarity, status, and group membership.
Using the suppression of
electroencephalographic (EEG) mu
oscillations during action observation as an
index of motor resonance, the current study
explores the role that mere differences in the
dominance related facial features can have
in how people process other’s actions. To
this aim we first conducted a pilot study to
categorize target images of faces as high

dominance, neutral, or low dominance
based on ratings of the participants’ face
image. In addition, a different sample of
participants watched videos of hands
performing simple actions ostensibly
belonging to individuals with faces varying in
dominance, while EEG was recorded.
Participants showed greater mu-suppression
for the more dominant-faced individuals,
supporting the theory that motor resonance
occurs more when viewing motivationally
relevant individuals rather than likable
individuals. This finding implies that subtle
differences in physical appearance, such as
dominance in a face, can affect motor
resonance, and thus potentially lead to more
submissive individuals being less understood
by peers.

PERCEIVING SOCIAL STATUS: AN ERP
INVESTIGATION OF THE EFFECTS OF
STATUS LEVEL AND DIMENSION!Ivo

Gyurovski - University of Chicago; Carlos

Jasmin Cloutier - University of Chicago –
Whereas the possession of a high status has
been linked to greater recognition and
prestige (Fiske 2010; Magee & Galinsky,
2008), little work has focused on the impact
of social status on person perception.
Following-up on previous functional brain
imaging work (Cloutier et al., 2012; Cloutier &
Gyurovski, 2014; Cloutier & Gyurovski, 2013),
we conducted an ERP investigation of the
impact of distinct status levels and
dimensions on person perception. To do so,
29 participants (4 excluded due to excessive
noise) were presented with faces paired with
either high moral, low moral, high financial,
low financial status. Following the training
procedure to paired faces with status
conditions, EEG data were collected, while
participants were asked to form impressions
of the targets and indicate their status. Time
course analysis was performed on the wave
forms. The results revealed an early main
effect of status level in early attentional
components (between 150 and 250 ms),
such that greater anterior negativity was
observed in response to High versus Low
status. The data produced an interaction
between status level and dimension in later
components of interest (between 400 and
600 ms) such that greater positivity was
observed in response to High Financial and
Low Moral status versus Low Financial and
High Moral status. These findings are

discussed in the context of the neural
correlates of the influence of social status on
person perception (Cloutier et al., 2012;

THE VALUE OF STATUS: HOW SOCIAL
STATUS IMPACTS REWARD LEARNING!

Jessica E. Koski - Temple University; Jessica A.
Collins - Massachusetts General Hospital,
Harvard Medical School; Ingrid R. Olson Temple University – High status individuals are
judged as more trustworthy and competent,
and viewing high status people is associated
with activity in neural regions involved in
reward processing. Here we tested whether
status biases reward-based decision-making
in a modified version of the Iowa Gambling
Task (IGT). Participants learned to associate
high or low status semantic information with 2
faces each, and these 4 faces then served
as stimuli in our social gambling task. In each
trial (400 total) the four faces were presented
simultaneously and participants were
instructed to choose a person to “invest”
with. They were told that some people were
better than others and that they should aim
to make as much money as possible by
choosing these individuals more often. Two
of the faces were associated with a net gain
(“good” choices) and the other 2 with a net
loss (“bad” choices), and these reward
contingencies reversed after 200 trials. We
compared IGT scores (good - bad choices)
when high status faces were good choices
to when low status faces were good choices.
Our data revealed higher IGT scores when
high status faces were good choices
indicating participants picked the high status
faces more often even if this resulted in
monetary loss. When high status faces were
initially good choices, participants suffered a
greater decrease in IGT score at the reversal
than when low status faces were initially
good choices. These data suggest status
information biases reward learning and
interferes with task performance.

OXYTOCIN FACILITATES SOCIAL

National University College of Medicine; Jun
Soo Kwon - Seoul National University College
of Medicine; Hackjin Kim - Korea University –
Oxytocin is known to influence various social
processes including social comparison
(Shamay-Tsoory et al., 2009). Based on the
previous findings that oxytocin increases ingroup favoritism and inter-group competition
(e.g., De Drue et al., 2010), the current study
examined the differential effects of oxytocin
on social comparison with out-group vs. ingroup member using a double-blind
placebo-controlled design. Thirty-one male
participants were randomly assigned to
either placebo or oxytocin treatment and
performed a social-comparison task
adapted from Kang et al. (2013), in which
they played a card selection game with
either an in-group or out-group member. In
each trial of the task, participants chose one
of three unrevealed cards. The outcome of
the choice was then presented with that of
the game partner. Participants were asked
to decide whether to accept or to repeat
the trial. Behavioral results showed that
compared to the placebo-treated
participants, the oxytocin-treated
participants were more likely to accept the
loss trials but only if they lost relatively fewer
points than an out-group member. No such
pattern was observed for the trials with an ingroup member. These findings suggest that
oxytocin selectively increases social
comparison with out-group members,
providing one possible mechanism
underlying the facilitating role of oxytocin in
inter-group competition.

DIFFERENTIAL EXPRESSIONS OF
INTERGROUP GUILT PREDICT BIASED
RECRUITMENT OF NEURAL NETWORKS
INTEGRAL FOR COGNITIVE CONTROL!

Adam B. Magerman - University of Delaware;
Chad E. Forbes - University of Delaware – The
experience of guilt promotes approachoriented behaviors, including greater interest
in prejudice reduction, and has been
associated with increases in cognitive control
and the inhibition of future unwanted
behaviors (e.g., Amodio et al., 2007). Less is
known, however, about how differences in
the experience of guilt following accidental
harmful behaviors towards racial ingroup
and outgroup members modulate changes
in cognitive control and inhibition of future
unwanted behaviors. Given that individuals

89

!
typically favor ingroup members more than
outgroup members, we hypothesized that
individuals will experience increased guilt
after exhibiting harmful behaviors towards
ingroup members compared to outgroup
members. Further, feelings of guilt will be
associated with increased connectivity
between the ACC and DLPFC (two regions
integral for cognitive control) and greater
accuracy on subsequent trials. This study
utilized a modified version of the Police
Officer’s Dilemma and lexical decision task.
On each trial, participants’ goal was to shoot
armed targets or not shoot unarmed targets.
Following each decision, participants were
presented with a word and asked to identify
whether it was either a guilt-related word or
a non-word. Faster reaction times to guilt
words indexed participant’s feelings of guilt
following shoot/no-shoot behaviors. Results
revealed that White participants
experienced increased guilt after erroneously
shooting the White target compared to the
Black target. Further, increased guilt was
associated with greater post-error ACCDLPFC connectivity and greater overall
accuracy during the task. Our findings
suggest that Whites seem to experience less
guilt and are less inclined to exhibit cognitive
control when accidentally harming outgroup
members.

TRUSTING OUTGROUP, BUT NOT INGROUP
MEMBERS, REQUIRES CONTROL: NEURAL
AND BEHAVIORAL EVIDENCE!Brent Hughes

- Stanford University; Jamil Zaki - Stanford
University – Ingroup favoritism, although
sometimes adaptive, often damages
people’s ability to trust and cooperate with
outgroup members. Intergroup failures in
trust produce a number of pernicious
consequences, such as escalated conflict,
and reducing conflict requires first
understanding why and how trust collapses
across group boundaries. To investigate this
issue, we asked participants to make singleshot decisions about whether to trust ingroup
or outgroup members with real money.
Decisions to trust ingroup members were
accompanied by engagement of rewardrelated neural structures (e.g., striatum). By
contrast, decisions to trust outgroup
members produced activity in neural systems
associated with top-down control (e.g.,
dACC). Individual differences in trust-related
activation in these systems further correlated

with individual differences in intergroup trust
bias: the extent to which participants
unevenly trusted ingroup over outgroup
members. These data suggest that trusting
outgroup, but not ingroup members requires
the exertion of executive processes. A
follow-up behavioral experiment further
supported this prediction: whereas time
pressure did not affect trust of ingroup
members, it reduced trust of outgroup
members. Together, these findings suggest
that intergroup failures in trust are multiply
determined: whereas people find it intuitive
and rewarding to trust ingroup members,
they may need to uniquely exert control to
override intuitive distrust of outgroup
members. These findings deepen our
knowledge of prosociality and intergroup
cognition, and have a number of
implications for intervening to reduce
conflict.

THE IMPACT OF CHILDHOOD INTERRACIAL
CONTACT ON BRAIN RESPONSES TO
FACES: A PARTIAL LEAST SQUARES
ANALYSIS!Tianyi Li - University of Chicago;
Carlos Cardenas-Iniguez - University of
Chicago; Marc G. Berman - University of
Chicago; Jasmin Cloutier - University of
Chicago – The potential for childhood
interracial exposure to shape race
perception is well-documented. Accordingly,
evidence from our previous study focusing
on the amygdala suggests that greater
interracial contact in childhood alters brain
responses to familiar Black individuals
(Cloutier, Li, & Correll, 2014). Whereas the
presentation of perceptually familiar faces
attenuated White perceivers’ amygdala
response to both Black and White faces,
reduction in amygdala response to familiar
Black faces was more pronounced among
perceivers with higher levels of childhood
interracial contact. In the current study, we
further explore the impact of early interracial
contact on brain responses by implementing
a Partial Least Squares (PLS) analysis to
uncover activity across a network of brain
regions covarying with interracial contact.
The PLS approach is a multivariate approach
to find significant relationships between
signal changes in brain regions and
experimental variables (e.g., behavioral
responses or experimental contrasts). Initial
analyses revealed a correlation between
interracial contact and a large network of

90

!
brain areas, including components of the socalled social brain, in response to all faces. In
addition, consistent with the long-standing
idea that greater interracial contact
promotes positive racial attitudes and
minimizes prejudice, interracial contact and
implicit prejudice demonstrated differential
correlations with activity in dorsal-frontal
brain regions.

AGE DIFFERENCES IN NEURAL RESPONSES
TO RACE EXIST WITHIN THE PREJUDICE
NETWORK Brittany S. Cassidy - Indiana

University; Anne C. Krendl - Indiana University
– Much work has characterized a network of
brain regions responding to different aspects
of race perception. For instance, amygdala
activity characterizes affective responses
while the engagement of regions involved in
cognitive control (e.g., dorsolateral and
ventrolateral prefrontal cortex [dlPFC; vlPFC])
reflects impulse regulation. This network may
be particularly impacted in older adults
because aging has been widely associated
with impairments in regulatory function.
Indeed, emerging behavioral research has
shown that age-related regulatory decline
exacerbates older adults’ prejudice. During
fMRI, 15 younger and 39 older adults viewed
Black and White faces and cars. Older adults
were normal functioning, but varied in their
relative amount of cognitive decline. When
perceiving Black versus White faces, younger
adults displayed increased engagement of
dlPFC and vlPFC – two regions implicated in
initiating and maintaining regulation – as
compared to older adults. For the same
contrast, younger adults also displayed
enhanced posterior cingulate activity
compared to older adults, suggesting less
individuation of Black versus White faces with
age. Given the critical role of the amygdala
within the prejudice network, we extracted
parameter estimates from anatomically
defined amygdala ROIs to assess a potential
relationship with regulatory function.
Importantly, poorer executive ability
predicted increased left amygdala response
to Black over White faces, suggesting
enhanced affective response given less
regulatory ability. These findings are the first
to reveal age differences in neural
recruitment within key nodes of the prejudice
network that impact the processing and
regulation of attitudes toward racial
outgroup members.

BEHAVIORAL AND NEURAL EVIDENCE FOR
THE EFFECT OF RESIDENTIAL MOBILITY ON
SOCIAL PERCEPTION!Brandon W. Ng -

University of Virginia; Shigehiro Oishi University of Virginia; James P. Morris University of Virginia – Prior work has
demonstrated that the experience of
moving—residential mobility—induces
anxiety, stress, and anticipated social
exclusion (Oishi, 2010). Simply priming
participants to think about moving causes
loneliness and motivates the desire to affiliate
and reconnect with others (Oishi et al., 2013).
Past research has demonstrated that basic
social perceptual processes, such as
attending to social cues are the essential
ingredients to forming social bonds (Pickett
et al., 2004). For instance, chronically lonely
individuals typically display heightened
sensitivity to social cues, relative to controls
(Gardner et al., 2005). Moreover, social
exclusion has been found to motivate
perceptual attention to happy faces in
particular, since a smile has been
hypothesized to be one of the greatest
indicators of a potential affiliative partner
(DeWall et al., 2006). However, research
examining how residential mobility may
attune social perception remains scarce. In
two studies, we hypothesized that residential
mobility would motivate engagement with
happy faces—to cues of acceptance. In
Study 1, participants were primed with
residential mobility, stability, or were in a
control condition and subsequently
completed a face evaluation task. Indeed,
participants primed with residential mobility
demonstrated increased explicit liking
toward happy faces, but not for any other
faces. In Study 2, we utilized ERPs to
investigate how early in the timecourse of
visual processing this motivated social
perception occurs. In line with hypotheses,
mobile-prime participants demonstrated
faster N170 latencies toward happy faces,
relative to stable-prime participants. Taken
together, the results demonstrate that
residential mobility sharpens social
perception to cues of acceptance.

Communication through body gestures
permeates our daily life. Efficient perception
of the message therein reflects one’s social
cognitive competency. Here we report that
such competency is manifested temporally
as shortened subjective duration of social
interactions: motion sequences showing
agents acting communicatively are
perceived to be significantly shorter in
duration as compared with those acting
independently. The strength of this effect is
negatively correlated with one’s autistic-like
tendency. Critically, intranasal oxytocin
administration fosters the temporal
compression effect in socially less proficient
individuals whereas the administration of
atosiban, a competitive antagonist of
oxytocin, abolishes the very effect in socially
proficient individuals. These findings clearly
indicate that perceived time, rather than
being a faithful representation of physical
time, is highly subjective and imprinted with
one’s social traits. Moreover, they highlight
the role of neuropeptides in mediating time
perception.

VAGAL TONE AND OXTR METHYLATION
EXPLAIN INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES IN
SOCIAL COGNITIVE ABILITY!Katie

Lancaster - University of Virginia; Jurie Han University of Virginia; Joyce Huang - University
of Virginia; Lacy Jennings - University of
Virginia; James P. Morris - University of
Virginia; Jessica, J. Connelly - University of
Virginia – Individuals differ in the ease with
which they navigate their social worlds, but
what are the origins of this variability? Deficits
in autism spectrum disorders (ASD) suggest
that one’s biology may exert considerable
influence over basic social cognitive
processes. We hypothesize that a spectrum
of social cognitive ability exists also in healthy
individuals, and is constrained by similar
mechanisms. In particular we examine two
interrelated biological factors which are

disrupted in ASD: vagal tone, and the
neurohormone oxytocin. Vagal tone,
measured by resting sinus arrhythmia (RSA), is
an index of parasympathetic control of the
autonomic nervous system. Feedback
through both the vagal and oxytocinergic
systems is thought to modulate social
behavior. The mechanism of action for
oxytocin is dependent upon availability of its
receptor, which is regulated in part by
expression of the oxytocin receptor gene
(OXTR). In the current study, we examined
DNA methylation of OXTR, an epigenetic
modification shown to inhibit gene
expression and hypothesized to negatively
affect endogenous oxytocinergic action.
Forty-two neurotypicals completed a
measure of social perception, the Reading
the Mind in the Eyes test, were assessed for
baseline RSA, and provided a blood sample
for epigenetic analysis. Results revealed that
baseline RSA was associated with increased
social perceptual performance while OXTR
methylation was associated with decreases
in both baseline RSA and social perceptual
performance. Importantly, baseline RSA did
not mediate the relationship between OXTR
methylation and social perception,
suggesting that parasympathetic and
epigenetic mechanisms are independent
predictors of individual differences in social
cognitive ability.

THE NEURAL EFFECTS OF COMPUTERIZED
SOCIAL COGNITIVE TRAINING!Erin T. Guty -

Harvard University; Cambria Litsey - Harvard
University; Mia Schulam - Harvard University;
David Dodell-Feder - Harvard University;
Christine I. Hooker - Harvard University –
Navigation of the social world is dependent
upon our ability to accurately perceive and
reason about the beliefs, emotions, and
intentions of others. Indeed, research from a
variety of fields, including clinical and nonclinical domains, has demonstrated a robust
link between social cognitive ability and real
world social functioning. These findings
highlight the potential utility in devising
methods to enhance social cognitive ability.
However, extant methods for training social
cognition, particularly for schizophrenia,
have focused on training the impaired social
behaviors themselves rather than targeting
the underlying processes and representations
that give rise to social behavior. Here, we
evaluate the effects of training social
cognition through the use of neuroplasticity-

92

!
based learning in healthy adults. Specifically,
participants from the community underwent
social cognitive training with computerized
exercises designed to tap the neural
mechanisms sub-serving social cognition for
a period of 8 hours over 2 weeks. Participants
underwent fMRI scanning before and after
training during which they performed a
theory of mind (ToM) task that involved
reading stories about character’s emotions
or physical appearances. We find trainingrelated increases in activation in the
somatosensory-related cortex from pre- to
post-training during the ToM task. This finding
suggests that social cognitive training may
lead to beneficial neural changes in regions
supporting social cognition, which may in
turn enhance real world social behavior.

ATTENTION VERSUS RECOGNITION:
DIFFERENCES IN EMOTION PROCESSING
DEFICITS IN AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDER
AND ALEXITHYMIA!Alicia Vallorani - Western
Illinois University; Naoyuki Sunami - Western
Illinois University; Sandra L. McFadden Western Illinois University; Masu Omura Western Illinois University; Ariel J. Wilson Western Illinois University; Phillip C. Berg Western Illinois University; Lindsey K. Robinson
- Western Illinois University – Autism Spectrum
Disorder (ASD) is defined by impaired social
interactions, communications and restricted
interests (American Psychiatric Association,
2013). Alexithymia is a sub-clinical disorder
described as an inability for individuals to
process and label emotions (Samur et al.,
2013). Recent research suggests that the
social-emotional deficits generally attributed
to ASD, including emotion recognition (Cook,
Brewer, Shah, & Bird, 2013), empathy (Bird et
al., 2010) and eye-fixation (Bird, Press, &
Richardson, 2011), are attributable to
comorbid Alexithymia. Other research,
however, suggests that Alexithymia is nothing
more than a deficit in verbal IQ
(Montebarocci et al., 2011). With this in
mind, the current study explored if
Alexithymia or ASD accounts for deficits in
emotion processing and labeling. A sample
of 79 undergraduate students completed
measures of Alexithymia and then performed
an emotion-labeling task while event related
potentials were recorded; 29 participants
also completed the Autism Spectrum
Quotient test. Data analysis revealed a
significant relationship between Alexithymia
and ASD (r = .37). Individuals high in ASD

reported typical responses to emotionevoking images (from Mikels et al., 2005), but
showed altered early and late slow wave
activity when viewing images that typically
evoke sadness. Individuals high in Alexithymia
did not show differences in neural activity,
but were less likely to report feeling sad in
response to sadness-eliciting stimuli. The
findings suggest that individuals with ASD
may not attend to sad emotional content
whereas individuals with Alexithymia may
have deficits in feeling or labeling sadness.

INTRODUCING RISC: A NEW INVENTORY
FOR TESTING SOCIAL PERCEPTION IN
NEUROPSYCHOLOGICAL POPULATIONS!

Kathrin Rothermich - School of
Communication Sciences and Disorders,
McGill University; Marc D. Pell - School of
Communication Sciences and Disorders,
McGill University – Nonliteral language, such
as jocularity, sarcasm, or white lies, occurs
frequently in daily communication. During
natural social interactions, linguistic and
paralinguistic information about nonliteral
speech unfolds simultaneously in several
communication channels. However, there
are four common limitations in studies
investigating social communication and
speaker intentions: (1) using only uni-modal
stimulation, i.e. visual; (2) designing static
experiments depicting stimuli that are far
away from everyday communication; (3)
neglecting important factors such as
discourse context and relationship type; and
(4) insufficient stimulus control and number of
trials to perform neuroimaging experiments.
Relational Inference in Social
Communication (RISC) is a newly developed
database, which entails short video vignettes
depicting social interactions, including
sincere, sarcastic, jocular, and white lie
exchanges. For the first time we also
manipulated the type of social relationship
between communication partners (e.g.
friends vs. couple) and carefully controlled
the availability of contextual cues (e.g.
preceding conversations) while keeping
lexical-semantic content constant. First
validation data reveals an overall accuracy
for identifying speaker intentions above 80 %,
indicating that our material is suitable for
testing healthy and neuropsychological
populations. Results further show that both
relationship type and context are influencing
the categorization of literal and nonliteral
interactions. This demonstrates that is

93

!
important to consider social as well as
discourse context when studying speaker
intentions. By including crucial aspects that
have often been neglected in previous
research, RISC represents a contemporary
set of naturalistic video stimuli that creates a
useful resource for future neuroscientific
research.

EPIGENETIC VARIABILITY OF THE
OXYTOCIN RECEPTOR GENE PREDICTS
INCREASED NEURAL RESPONSE TO
EMOTIONAL FACE EXPRESSIONS!Meghan

H. Puglia - University of Virginia; Travis S. Lillard
- University of Virginia; James P. Morris University of Virginia; Jessica J. Connelly University of Virginia – Understanding the
precise nature of oxytocin’s influence on
complex human social behavior has proven
difficult. Most human work on oxytocin has
focused on intranasal administration without
regard to individual biological variability in
the oxytocinergic system. Work focusing on
individual variability has measured either
hormonal levels assayed from the blood or
common genetic variants. However the use
of these markers is limited because they
have no known function. The current study
utilizes an imaging epigenetic approach to
further parse the effects of individual
variability in the oxytocinergic system on
social processes. We find that a functional
epigenetic variant, DNA methylation of the
oxytocin receptor gene (OXTR), is associated
with neural variability in healthy adults during
an emotional face-perception fMRI
paradigm. Importantly, this modification is
variable in the general population, can be
assayed in the blood, and impacts the
expression of the gene. Our results indicate
that higher levels of OXTR methylation are
associated with greater amounts of activity
in regions associated with face and emotion
processing including amygdala, fusiform and
insula. Furthermore, these higher methylation
levels are also associated with decreased
functional coupling of amygdala with
regions involved in affect appraisal and
emotion regulation including dorsal anterior
cingulate cortex and orbitofrontal cortex. This
pattern of activity may be indicative of
diminished emotion regulation to negative
stimuli and increased risk of pathology. Our
findings highlight the importance of including
epigenetic mechanisms in the description of
the endogenous oxytocin system and further

support a central role for oxytocin in social
cognition.

Human referential communication is often
adjusted to the presumed knowledge and
characteristics of the addressee (“audience
design”). Here we explore if and how
oxytocin, a neuropeptide known to promote
prosocial behaviours and to sharpen
processing of socially-relevant information,
modulates qualitative and quantitative
markers of audience design. Fifty-eight
healthy male adults participated in a
randomised, double-blind, placebo
controlled experiment involving the
intranasal administration of oxytocin. Markers
of audience design were quantified during
performance of an online interactive
referential game, which challenges
participants into continuous negotiation of
novel communicative behaviours with their
addressees. Crucially, participants were
made to believe that they were playing this
game with either an age-peer or a child
addressee. In fact, a confederate performed
the role of both addressees, while remaining
blind as to whether they played as adult or
as child. There are two novel findings. First,
oxytocin drives interlocutors to adjust their
communicative behaviour towards the

94

!
actual performance experienced in
addressees, and away from their beliefs on
the abilities of those addressees. Second,
oxytocin enables participants to find
communicative strategies that could
unambiguously cover the complex problemspace of the game. Currently, we are
investigating how these findings can be
correlated with changes in resting state
connectivity between regions known to
support the generation and understanding of
novel communicative behaviours.

EARLY INFLUENCE OF COMPARISON ON
SOCIAL INFORMATION PROCESSING EVIDENCE FROM TWO EEG STUDIES!

Katharina Banscherus - University of Cologne;
Jutta Stahl - University of Cologne; Thomas
Mussweiler - University of Cologne;
Gayannée Kedia - University of Graz – A
large body of research has shown that
comparisons play a fundamental role in how
we perceive ourselves and other people.
Yet, when exactly comparisons take effect
during the stream of social information
processing on the neural level remains
unclear. To bridge this gap, we designed two
EEG studies investigating the neural time
course of attractiveness and trustworthiness
comparisons. Size comparisons served as the
non-social control condition in both studies.
To determine the moment of comparison, we
used a distance effect (DE) paradigm. The
DE refers to the fact that stimuli close on a
certain dimension (low distance) take longer
to compare than stimuli that clearly differ on
that respective dimension (high distance). In
Study 1, participants performed
attractiveness and size comparisons during
EEG recording while being presented with
two images displaying female faces
simultaneously. Depending on the condition,
images varied in distance with regard to
either attractiveness or size. In Study 2,
participants compared the trustworthiness
and size of two simultaneously presented
faces. These pairs likewise varied in distance.
Our analysis revealed that comparison
related differences occurred around 200
milliseconds (N2) after stimulus onset for
attractiveness/size and already after 100
milliseconds (N1) for trustworthiness/size
comparisons. Both, social
(attractiveness/trustworthiness) and nonsocial (size) comparisons followed the same
time course. These studies suggest that
comparative information is processed very

early throughout stimulus evaluation and
emphasize how basic comparison is in social
information processing.

CONSCIOUS AND UNCONSCIOUS
INTEGRATION OF EMOTIONAL EYE GAZE
AND AFFECTIVE CONTEXT!Qian Xu -

Chinese Academy of Sciences; Ying Wang Chinese Academy of Sciences; Yi Jiang Chinese Academy of Sciences – Social cues,
such as facial expression and the direction of
eye gaze, are usually perceived within
natural context. However, the perceptual
integration of these social cues and their
context remains largely unexplored. Here we
looked into the integration process using
emotional gaze cues along with taskirrelevant affective pictures. Participants
viewed happy or fearful faces whose eyes
could gaze at an affective picture or not
(gaze congruency), and the valence of the
affective picture was either congruent or
incongruent with the facial expression
(emotion congruency). Results showed a
significant interaction of gaze congruency
and emotion congruency for fearful faces
but not for happy faces, regardless of
whether the stimuli were visible or rendered
invisible through the continuous flash
suppression paradigm. Interestingly, the
integration process showed dissociable
patterns with respect to the participant’s trait
anxiety and the stimulus visibility: compared
with low trait anxiety, high trait anxiety
boosted the integration of invisible fearful
information though reduced the effect in the
visible condition. To sum up, fearful gaze
cues can trigger affective social information
integration independent of conscious
awareness, and the effect is modulated by
one’s trait anxiety level.

THE NON-CONSCIOUS PROCESSING OF
FEARFUL FACES!Lili Wang - Huaiyin Normal

University; Chunliang Feng - Beijing Normal
University; Xiaoqin Mai - Renmin University of
China; Yue-jia Luo - Shenzhen University –
Emotional stimuli can be processed without
consciousness. In the current study, we used
event-related potentials (ERPs) to assess
whether perceptual load influences nonconscious processing of fearful facial
expressions. Perceptual load was

95

!
manipulated using a letter search task with
the target letter presented at the fixation
point, while facial expressions were
presented peripherally and masked to
prevent conscious awareness. The letter
string comprised six letters (X or N) that were
identical (low load) or different (high load).
Participants were instructed to discriminate
the letters at fixation or the facial expression
(fearful or neutral) in the periphery.
Participants were faster and more accurate
at detecting letters in the low load condition
than in the high load condition. Fearful faces
elicited a sustained positivity from 250 ms to
700 ms post-stimulus over fronto-central areas
during the face discrimination and low-load
letter discrimination conditions, but this effect
was completely eliminated during high-load
letter discrimination. Our findings imply that
non-conscious processing of fearful faces
depends on perceptual load, and
attentional resources are necessary for nonconscious processing.

SYNCHRONIZED FMRI AND MOTIONTRACKING REVEALS THE CO-ACTIVATION
OF MULTIPLE SOCIAL CATEGORIES!Ryan M.

Stolier - New York University; Jonathan B.
Freeman - New York University – Humans
readily sort one another into multiple social
categories, though cues used to do so are
not always clear-cut. Atypical category
members may be readily encountered (e.g.,
feminine men, White people with Afrocentric
features). Recently, behavioral studies using
hand-motion tracking have suggested that
categorizing such individuals is accomplished
through dynamic competition between
parallel, partially-activated social categories
that rapidly resolve into a stable categorical
percept. During event-related fMRI,
participants categorized faces by either
gender or race. Faces varied in category
typicality, such that some faces belonging to
one category contained partial cues
belonging to the opposite category (e.g.,
male face with feminine cues). FMRI was
coupled with online hand-motion tracking,
where participant hand-motion towards the
unselected category response indexed the
degree to which atypical category members
activated the opposite category in parallel.
Multivariate pattern analyses revealed that
neural representations of atypical (vs.
typical) category members were more similar
to the opposite category representation in
several regions of the ventral-temporal

cortex. Importantly, on-line hand-motion
towards the opposite category response
predicted neural-pattern similarity of atypical
faces to the average representational
pattern of the opposite category in fusiform
cortex. Thus, despite consistent final
categorizations of atypical faces as
belonging to one category, their multi-voxel
representational patterns showed similarity to
their opposing categories. These results
bolster current computational models of
social categorization, and offer a promising
methodology for the investigation of parallel
and competitive processes.

RETRIEVAL-RELATED REACTIVATION OF
VISUAL PROCESSING REGIONS
EXHIBITING FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY
WITH THE AMYGDALA DURING
SUCCESSFUL ENCODING OF NEGATIVE
AND POSITIVE INFORMATION!Sarah M.

Kark - Boston College; Elizabeth A. Kensinger
- Boston College – Prior work has shown
increased connectivity between the
amygdala and visual areas during successful
encoding of negative information (MickleySteinmetz, Addis, & Kensinger, 2010). In the
present functional magnetic resonance
imaging (fMRI) study, we examined retrievalrelated reactivation of visual areas that were
functionally coupled with the amygdala
during successful encoding of negative and
positive information. Seventeen participants
(aged 19-35) studied line-drawings of
International Affective Picture System (IAPS)
images that had negative, positive, or
neutral valence, followed by the complete
color photos. After a 20-minute delay,
participants viewed line-drawing outlines
created from studied photos and from
nonstudied lures. Participants were asked to
indicate whether each line-drawing was old
or new. During encoding, increased coupling
between the amygdala and visual cortices
(BA18, 19) predicted subsequent memory for
negative items while increased coupling
between the amygdala and middle and
inferior temporal gyri (BA20, 21) predicted
subsequent memory for positive items.
Conjunction analyses were used to examine
retrieval-related reactivation of visual
processing regions that showed functional
coupling with the amygdala during
successful encoding. There was significant
retrieval-related reactivation in the fusiform
gyrus (BA37) for negative items and middle

96

!
temporal gyrus (BA20) for positive items.
However, there was no significant encodingto-retrieval overlap in amygdala connectivity
within the ventral visual stream for negative
or positive items. Together, the results
demonstrate retrieval-related reactivation of
visual areas functionally coupled with the
amygdala during successful encoding of
negative and positive information. These
findings emphasize the enhancing effect
amygdala engagement during encoding on
subsequent retrieval-related reactivation in
occipitotemporal regions.

MULTI-VOXEL PATTERNS AT ENCODING
CLASSIFY VIVIDNESS OF EMOTIONAL
MEMORIES!John C. Ksander - Boston

College; Christopher R. Madan - Boston
College; Drew Linsley - Boston College;
Katherine Mickley Steinmetz - Wofford
College; Elizabeth A. Kensinger - Boston
College – Emotion tends to enhance
subjective evaluations of memory quality
even without other measurable
improvements in memory performance. It is
debated whether these subjective
enhancements reflect a recognition criterion
bias or maintenance of information that
cannot be objectively measured. The
present study offers insight into this debate by
examining the relationship between brain
activity during memory formation and
subsequent vividness ratings, using a novel
multivariate approach. In an event-related
fMRI task, participants studied positive,
negative, and neutral complex scenes.
Memory was tested using a recognition task
with a modified Memory Characteristics
Questionnaire (Mickley Steinmetz et al.,
2012). Distributed patterns of activation
elicited in medial temporal lobe regions
successfully decoded vividness ratings of
positive, but not neutral or negative items.,
We found that vividness for positive scenes
was decoded in the bilateral hippocampus,
left amygdala, and left parahippocampal
cortex. Furthermore, each participant’s
vividness for positive scenes could be
decoded using patterns from the other
participants. Importantly, information about
positive scenes’ vividness was not in the
univariate analyses. These findings suggest
that encoding processes within the medial
temporal lobe influence subsequent memory
vividness evaluations, but also that they
interact with emotional valence. These

findings suggest that subjective vividness of
positive scenes is a distributed representation
in the medial temporal lobe regions, that is,
to an extent, common across subjects. In this
way, multivariate analyses of brain activity
are well positioned to uncover the neural
basis of emotional effects on memory.

NEUROPHYSIOLOGICAL CORRELATES OF
FEEDBACK SENSITIVITY IN AN EMOTION
PERCEPTION DECISION!Spencer K. Lynn -

Northeastern University; Yael Arbel - MGH
Institute of Health Professions; Lisa Feldman
Barrett - Northeastern University – Emotion
perception is a judgment made under
uncertainty (a given facial expression can
mean different things) and risk (there are
costs to being wrong about the meaning of
a facial expression). A person's sensitivity to
benefits or costs may influence how effective
he or she is at making such judgments.
Participants (n=25) completed an anger
detection task under perceptual uncertainty
("angry" and "not angry" categories shared
morphed facial scowl intensities) and
economic risk (correct detections and
correct rejections of anger earned points,
false alarms and missed detections of anger
lost points). Decision feedback, statements of
points earned or lost, was delivered on each
trial. Point values were skewed to favor a "not
angry" response bias. Participants attempted
to earn as many points as they could over
890 trials. We created event related
potentials time-locked to the onset of the
four feedback types and performed
temporal PCA on the average voltage at the
Fz, Cz, and Pz electrodes. To compare
relative feedback sensitivities we analyzed
sums and differences of component
amplitudes. Perceptual sensitivity correlated
(two-tailed alpha=.05) with amplitude of
central components peaking near 150 and
450 ms (r^2s=.22-.46) and parietal
components peaking near 450 ms (r^2s=.18.29). Adequacy of response bias correlated
with amplitude of frontal components
peaking near 100 and 450 ms (r^2s=.17-.19).
Reward and punishment sensitivity, reflected
in cortical activity, affected judgments about
the emotional states of others by influencing
people's abilities to discriminate emotional
states and optimally balance their exposure
to the economic risk of miscategorization.

FACING THE FACTS: ASSESSING THE ROLE
OF FACE-BEHAVIOR INCONGRUITIES IN
SOCIAL COGNITION THROUGH THE
MODULATION OF THE N400!Jennifer L.

Crawford - Brandeis University; Laura E. Paige
- Brandeis University; Brittany S. Cassidy Indiana University; Angela H. Gutchess Brandeis University – Research has begun to
investigate how the interplay of facial
features and behaviors affect character
judgments, showing that people make more
extreme judgments about others when their
face and behavior are congruent (e.g., both
suggest trustworthy or positive traits, rather
than the face looking untrustworthy but the
behavior suggesting positive character). The
neural response to person perception when
face and behavioral information are either
congruent or incongruent is not fully
understood. Previous fMRI work revealed the
role of the dorsal-medial prefrontal cortex
(dmPFC) in updating social information,
showing greater dmPFC activation for
incongruent compared to congruent social
and emotional information. However, the
neural mechanism involved in the updating
of face- and behavior-based impressions has
not been elucidated. We used event-related
potentials (ERPs) to explore how incongruent
versus congruent face-behavior information
is processed as a function of the amplitude
of the N400, an ERP component involved in
semantic processing, ranging from
approximately 300-500ms. The amplitude of
the N400 response is most susceptible to
experimental manipulation. Participants
viewed differing pairs of faces (varying on
degree of trustworthiness) and behavioral
sentences (reflecting positive or negative
character), which allowed us to record the
neural activity underlying the processing of
both congruent and incongruent facebehavior relationships involved in social
cognition. ERP analyses indicate that when
presented with incongruent face-behavior
information, the amplitude of the N400
increases compared to congruent facebehavior information. This suggests that when
confronted with conflicting information
about a person’s facial characteristics and
behavior, semantic-processing networks may
be recruited to resolve this incongruency.

THE ROLE OF EMOTION WORDS IN THE
EXPERIENCE AND PERCEPTION OF
EMOTION: A META-ANALYSIS OF THE

NEUROIMAGING LITERATURE!Jeffrey A.

- The University of North Carolina at Chapel
Hill; Maria Gendron - Northeastern University;
Ajay B. Satpute - Pomona College; Katie
Hoemann - Northeastern University; Kristen A.
Lindquist - The University of North Carolina at
Chapel Hill – Recent work supporting a
psychological constructionist approach to
emotion suggests that the language we use
to describe emotions can also partially
constitute them (Lindquist et al. in press). A
constructionist approach hypothesizes that
affect is represented in the brain differently
when experienced or perceived in the
context of emotion words. To observe the
differences in neural activity when emotion
words were present vs. not present in an
experimental task, we performed a metaanalysis of the neuroimaging literature on
emotion. We included 809 contrasts across
352 studies in a Multilevel Kernel Density
Analysis (MDKA) performed in NeuroElf.
When emotion words were present (v. not
present) in experimental tasks, there was
more frequent activity in the thalamus (p <
.001) and at a lower threshold (p < .02), the
dorsal anterior insula, left inferior frontal gyrus,
and caudate nucleus. By contrast, when
emotion words were not present in
experimental tasks (v. present), there was
more frequent activity in the right amygdala
(p < .001). Together, these findings are
consistent with evidence from studies of
“affect labeling” (Lieberman et al. 2007),
which show decreased activity in the
amgydala when participants label the
meaning of facial expressions of emotion.
Our findings are also consistent with the
constructionist view that words help make
meaning of otherwise ambiguous affective
states by increasing sensory processing of
affective stimuli and reducing their
uncertainty. Implications for the role of
emotion words in emotional experiences and
perceptions will be discussed.

SEMANTIC PRIMING OVERRIDES
AFFECTIVE PRIMING DURING THE N400

Tufts University; Gina Kuperberg - Tufts
University – Semantic priming describes the
faster response to target words preceded by
semantically associated versus unassociated
words. Affective priming describes the faster
response to emotional words preceded by
words of the same emotional valence. A
large event-related potential (ERP) literature
suggests that semantic priming results in
facilitated lexico-semantic processing,
reflected by an attenuation of the N400, but
the ERP signatures of affective priming have
been mixed. In a previous ERP study, we fully
crossed semantic (Associated vs.
Unassociated) and affective (Same Valence
vs. Opposite Valence) priming, where
participants explicitly judged semantic
association of each word-pair. While we
found the expected effect of semantic
priming, we saw no N400 or late positivity
effect to affective priming, suggesting that
when experimental conditions that
encourage semantic associative processing,
affective priming does not influence lexicosemantic processing. In the present
experiment, we asked participants to
explicitly judge whether each word pair had
the same (or opposite) valence, to overtly
focus attention on emotional features of the
prime and target. Again, we saw no effect of
affective priming on the N400 (which was still
sensitive to semantic priming) or the late
positivity (which was still sensitive overall to
the valence of the targets). Instead, we
found an early N1 effect of affective priming.
This suggests that when primes and targets in
an experiment share a salient relationship
other than valence, affective priming
influences early automatic processes, but not
later lexico-semantic or evaluative
processes, which may be more controloriented.

LONG-RANGE WHITE MATTER
CONNECTIVITY PREDICTS FACIAL
EMOTION PERCEPTION!Ashley Unger -

Temple University; Kylie H. Alm - Temple
University; Jessica Collins - Massachusetts
General Hospital, Harvard Medical School;
Jackie O'Leary - Temple University; Tehila
Nugiel - Temple University; Ingrid R. Olson Temple University – The extended face
network contains groups of neurons that
perform distinct functions on facial stimuli:
regions in the posterior ventral visual stream
appear to perform basic perceptual
functions on faces, while more anterior

regions, such as the ventral anterior temporal
lobe (vATL) and amygdala, function to link
mnemonic and affective information to
faces. These regions are interconnected by
long-range white matter tracts; however, the
functional significance of these pathways is
poorly understood. One study found face
emotion processing deficits in a small sample
of individuals with brain lesions affecting the
inferior longitudinal fasciculus (ILF), a tract
connecting ventral extrastriate cortex to the
vATL and amygdala, and the inferior frontooccipital fasciculus (IFOF), which connects
extrastriate cortex to portions of the frontal
lobe (Philippi et. al, 2009). Here, our goal was
to extend that research to a sample of
neurologically normal adults. Study
participants completed several face
perception tasks, including a difficult
emotion discrimination task. Diffusion tensor
imaging and deterministic tractography
were used to delineate the ILF and IFOF.
Regression analyses revealed a significant
relationship between the microstructural
properties of the left ILF and IFOF and
individual differences in emotion
discrimination ability. ILF/IFOF microstructure
also predicted gestalt pattern and facial
identity recognition, however no relationship
to face-perception was found in a control
tract, the uncinate fasciculus. We propose
that the ILF and IFOF play an important role
in face perception and the processing of
emotions.

performance and neural underpinnings
similar to the neutral voice condition,
whereas anger voice induction led to
improved logical reasoning as well as neural
underpinnings that were dissociated from
those associated with the neutral voice
condition. From this, we conclude that
reasoning in an angry auditory context is
characterized differently from reasoning in a
neutral context.

TRANSCRANIAL DIRECT CURRENT
STIMULATION OF THE EXTRASTRIATE BODY
AREA MODULATES IMPLICIT ANTI-FAT
BIAS. !Valentina Cazzato - University of

Udine, University of Bradford; Stergios Makris University of Udine, Edge Hill University;
Cosimo Urgesi - University of Udine, Bangor
University – Explicit negative attitudes and
beliefs towards obese individuals are well
documented (e.g. Ata & Thompson, 2010).
Several studies have shown that the
Extrastriate Body Area (EBA) in the lateral
occipital cortex is critical for body aesthetic
perception (Calvo-Merino et al., 2010;
Cazzato et al., 2014). Nevertheless, it is still
unclear whether EBA serves a role in implicit
weight-stereotypical bias, thus reflecting a
top-down modulation in the aesthetic
preference for slim as compared to
overweight/obese bodies. Here, we tested
the causal role of EBA in triggering implicit
weight and aesthetic stereotypical
associations (i.e. “ugly” with overweight and
“beauty” with slim) by modulating EBA
excitability by means of transcranial direct
current stimulation (tDCS). An ad-hoc
personality-IAT (i.e. “bad” with overweight
and “good” with slim), which focused on
body-concepts nonrelated to aesthetic
representations, was developed as a control
condition. Anodal, cathodal, or sham tDCS
(2 mA, 10min) over the right and left EBA was
administered to 12 female and 12 male
participants. Preliminary results showed that
applying cathodal stimulation over left-EBA
reduced the weight-bias for the personalityIAT in male participants, as compared to
anodal and sham stimulation over the same
hemisphere. The effect was specific for the
polarity and hemisphere of stimulation. To the
opposite, female participants did not show
any significant tDCS modulation in both IATs.
The present results suggest that negative
attitudes towards obese people may

depend on neural signals from the
extrastriate visual cortex.

SELECTIVE ENCODING OF THREAT

Institut National de la Santé et de la
Recherche Médicale, Département d’Etudes
Cognitives, Ecole Normale Supérieure – The
ability to correctly decode others’ emotional
expressions and to rapidly and accurately
select the most relevant course of action
bears survival advantages. Such ability
depends not only on the proper
identification of the emitted signal, often
complex or ambiguous under natural
settings, but also on the evaluation of its
significance for the observer. Particularly, an
angry face is more relevant when looking
towards an observer who becomes the
target of the threat, whereas a fearful face
looking away from the observer may signal a
potential threat in the environment. Here,
using electroencephalography, we aim to
identify the mechanisms underlying the
categorization of facial expressions and the
impact of threat relevance on these
mechanisms. We manipulated
parametrically the intensity of fearful and
angry expressions and their relevance during
a Fear-Anger categorization task.
Behaviorally, threat relevant emotions
benefited from an increased perceptual
sensitivity as observed on the slope
parameter of the psychometric function.
Further supporting this result, single-trial EEG
signals regressed against the intensity of
emotional expressions revealed that intensity
correlated better with EEG signals for
relevant emotions as soon as 170 ms after
stimulus onset. Interestingly, relevant
emotions were exclusively encoded in motor
structures at 200 ms after stimulus onset,
when time-frequency decompositions of
motor EEG signals in the mu-beta band were
regressed against intensity. To conclude, our
data provides converging evidence that
gaze direction contextually tunes emotion
categorization in a selective fashion, by
enhancing sensitivity to the emotion most

relevant to the observer in the associated
social context.

EMOTIONAL PROSODY PERCEPTION IN
HEALTHY AGEING – EVIDENCE FROM ERPS
AND RECOGNITION RATES!Silke Paulmann -

University of Essex; Chelsea Harmsworth University of Essex; Riccardo Russo - University
of Essex – Existing research on emotional
speech perception across the life-span
suggests that the ability to understand
emotions from speech can be altered in
healthy ageing (e.g. Ruffman et al., 2008).
However, the extent and underlying cause
remains to be determined. We believe that
the questions why and how emotional
speech perception is altered in healthy
ageing can only be adequately addressed
by acknowledging that emotional speech
perception is a multi-step process mediated
by a diverse brain network (e.g. Kotz &
Paulmann, 2011). Any disruption in the
'processing line' may lead to an altered
ability to perceive the emotional intention of
a speaker. Thus, here we investigated
different stages of emotional speech
perception by means of time-sensitive eventrelated brain potentials (ERPs) and
behavioural responses in a group of healthy
ageing (65+ years) and a University student
population. Specifically, we investigated
early emotional salience detection (as
reflected in the P200 ERP component) as well
as performance on an emotional prosody
recognition task. A significant P200 effect
showing that neutral prosody can be
distinguished from emotional (i.e. anger,
disgust, sad, pleasant surprise) prosody was
found for both groups suggesting that
emotional salience detection is not altered in
healthy ageing. In contrast, emotional
prosody recognition accuracy rates in elderly
are significantly reduced. This suggests that
elderly might experience problems in using
the correctly identified acoustic input to
accurately categorize specific emotions at
later processing stages.

A SLIPPERY SLOPE: NEURAL ADAPTATION
TO DISHONEST BEHAVIOR!Neil Garrett -

University College London; Stephanie C.
Lazzaro - University College London; Dan
Ariely - Fuqua School of Business, Duke
University; Tali Sharot - University College
London – Humans are proficient at adapting

to new contexts including aversive
circumstances such as bereavement and
disability (Fredrick & Lowenstein, 1999;
Brickman et al., 1978). In this study we explore
the possibility that individuals adapt, not only
to external circumstances and stimuli, but
also to aversive properties of their own
immoral decisions. Our results show that
interpersonal deception in a 2 party game
increases linearly over time in a context in
which deception benefits both parties
(deceiver and deceived) and when it
accrues benefits to the deceiver only. This
implies that small acts of dishonesty when
repeated escalate into greater ones. fMRI
results suggest that the biological
mechanism for this escalation over time is
neural adaptation of the right amygdala
and rostral anterior cingulate cortex in
response to an individual’s own dishonest
behaviour. Finally, we show that the degree
of neural adaptation acts as a “teaching
signal”, escalating the likelihood of
subsequent dishonest behaviour. Our findings
are the first to suggest that adaptation can
occur in response to our own decisions and
that this could be a mechanism by which
dishonest behaviour is given licence to
escalate.

sought to investigate how the loss and the

behaviors during ultimatum bargaining and
the underlying neural basis. During the
experiment, the participants were first played
the ball-guessing game, in which they gain
or loss RMB 20 (gain or loss context) and then
played an adapted version of the Ultimatum
Game as responders during which they split
60 chips. Participants were informed
beforehand that the chips were worth twice
as much to them as to the proposer and this
information was only known to them, but not
the proposer. They could tell the truth or lie
by sending alternative message “one chip
was worth RMB 2 to me” (no deception) or
“one chip was worth RMB 1 to me”
(deception) to the proposer. At the
behavioral level, higher deception rates

101

!
were observed for loss context than gain
context. At the neural level, greater
deception-related activation (relative to
honest) in the bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal
cortex and right caudate nucleus were
found during in the gain context compared
to the loss context. These preliminary findings
suggested that the neural basis of deception
decisions was modulated by the contexts
(i.e. loss vs. gain) and pointed to an
important role for DLPFC in deception
behavior.

THE NEURAL CORRELATES OF DETECTING
DECEPTION IN HUMAN BODY
MOVEMENTS.!Stergios Makris - Edge Hill

University; Cosimo Urgesi - Universita degli
Studi di Udine – There is mounting research
evidence showing that watching others'
actions triggers action resonance in the
motor cortex (Fadiga et al, 2005).
Furthermore, motor resonance processes
have been found to be modulated by
erroneous actions, such as fake or deceitful
actions (Tidoni et al, 2013). However, the
underlying neural mechanisms for detecting
deceptive movements are still not fully
understood. In the present study we
presented short video-clips of actors
performing an every-day action (i.e.
reaching, grasping and lifting a metal cube).
There were three types of videos; true actions
(TA), fake actions (FA; actors purposely
performing an action incongruent to the real
weight of the cube), deceit actions (DA;
actors unintentionally performing an action
incongruent to the cube after being
deceived about the real weight of the
object). The experimental task involved
participants watching the video-clips and
then having to indicate the weight of the
object (heavy or light). At the same time we
interfered by means of online repetitive
transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) over
brain areas associated with the action
observation network; namely the superior
temporal sulcus (STS), the anterior
intraparietal area (AIP), as well as the ventral
and dorsal premotor cortices. The results
have indicated a strong modulation of
performance in the task for both fake and
deceit actions, following the downgrading of
brain areas associated with action
observation and action resonance.
Therefore, our findings provide causative
evidence about critical brain areas and

mechanisms for recognizing fake and/or
deceptive body movements.

DECREASED AMYGDALA ACTIVATION
AND FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY

UNEMOTIONAL TRAITS DURING MORAL
JUDGMENTS OF CAUSING FEAR!Elise M.

Cardinale - Georgetown University; Andrew
A. Breeden - Georgetown University; Emily L.
Robertson - Georgetown University; Leah M.
Lozier - Georgetown University; Abigail A.
Marsh - Georgetown University – The present
study examined the role of emotion
processing in moral judgment in adolescents
ages 10-17, with varying degrees of
externalizing conduct problems and callous
unemotional (CU) traits. CU traits correspond
to the emotional and interpersonal
characteristics of adult psychopathy. CU
traits are consistently linked to deficits in fear
processing and severe, persistent behavior
problems. However, no study has yet
examined the role that deficits in fear
processing play in moral decision-making in
children with CU traits. We aimed to address
this gap using the Emotionally Evocative
Statements Task (EEST). The EEST contains 120
statements designed to elicit anger, disgust,
fear, happiness or disgust or which are
neutral. During fMRI scanning, participants
viewed each statement and indicated
whether it would ever be morally
acceptable to say that statement to another
person. A group x emotion interaction
emerged in the left amygdala such that, in
children with CU traits, the left amygdala was
significantly less active during evaluations
about causing others to feel fear. Preliminary
generalized psychophysiological interactions
(gPPI) analyses also revealed decreased
functional connectivity between the left
amygdala and right medial temporal lobe as
well as the ventral medial prefrontal cortex
during judgments about causing others fear
among children with high levels of CU traits.
Together, these results suggest that children
with CU traits may rely on distinct neural
mechanisms when evaluating the moral
permissibility of causing others to feel fear.

THE PLEASURE OF REVENGE: RETALIATORY
AGGRESSION ARISES FROM A NEURAL
IMBALANCE TOWARD REWARD!David S.

!
DeWall - University of Kentucky – Most of daily
life hums along peacefully but provocations
tip the balance toward aggression. Negative
feelings are often invoked to explain why
people lash out after an insult. Yet people
might retaliate because provocation makes
aggression hedonically rewarding. To test this
alternative hypothesis, 68 participants
underwent fMRI while they completed a
behavioral aggression task that repeatedly
manipulated whether aggression was
preceded by an instance of provocation or
not. After provocation, greater activity in the
central node of the brain’s reward network
(the NAcc) predicted more aggression.
Greater NAcc activation also helped predict
participants’ history of real-world violence.
Functional connectivity between the NAcc
and a regulatory region in the lateral
prefrontal cortex related to lower retaliatory
aggression. It appears that provocation tips
the neural balance towards hedonic reward,
which fosters retaliatory aggression. The
pleasure of inflicting pain appears to drive
retaliatory aggression, but self-regulatory
processes can keep aggressive urges at bay.

PERCEPTIONS OF MORALS AS SUBJECTIVE
OR OBJECTIVE RELY ON THEORY OF MIND!
Jordan Theriault - Boston College; Adam
Waytz - Northwestern University; Larisa
Heiphetz - Boston College; Liane Young Boston College – Ideological conflict tends to
stem from disagreement over moral issues,
and the resolution of such disagreement
requires a sophisticated understanding of
how people process moral beliefs. Although
some developmental psychologists have
claimed that moral beliefs are largely
perceived as objective, this work has largely
focused on uncontroversial, “prototypical”
morals (i.e. clear acts of harm). Meanwhile,
recent work in social psychology has
uncovered considerable variability in adults’
perceptions of morals as objective. The
present research examined the conditions
under which people process a broad range
of moral propositions as objective (fact-like)
or subjective (preference-like), employing a
combination of behavioral methods,
functional magnetic resonance imaging
(fMRI) and transcranial magnetic stimulation
(TMS). In the scanner, participants evaluated
statements concerning morals, facts, and
preferences. Behaviorally and neurally,
morals, overall, were processed as similar to

preferences. Morals and preferences
produced similar patterns and magnitudes of
activity across brain regions that support
theory of mind (ToM). However, widely
endorsed morals were perceived as more
objective (fact-like), and, similar to facts,
elicited reduced activity in ToM brain regions.
Reduced activity in right temporoparietal
junction (RTPJ) in particular correlated with
behavioral ratings of morals as objective,
and, when RTPJ activity was disrupted using
TMS, moral propositions typically perceived
as subjective were perceived as more
objective. Our findings illustrate the role of
mental state reasoning (as indexed by RTPJ
activity) in perceptions of moral objectivity.
Our findings reveal that ToM activity, while
similar overall between moral beliefs and
preferences, has a distinct profile in each
domain.!

BALANCING THE MORAL BANK: NEURAL
MECHANISMS OF RECIPROCITY!Yuanbo

Wang - Brown University; Jorie Koster-Hale Harvard University; Fiery Cushman - Harvard
University – Reciprocity depends on two
processes: encoding information about
social partners’ generosity, and retrieving
that information in order to guide subsequent
choice. We know much about these
processes in isolation, but less about the way
in which they are integrated. In this study we
identify neural correlates of encoding and
retrieval that underlie reciprocity in a
sequential prisoner’s dilemma. We recruited
twenty-nine subjects to play a round-robin
economic game in the fMRI scanner. Each
participant interacted with multiple players
characterized by variable degrees of
generosity. Based on prior research and
computational models (see Koster-Hale, &
Saxe, 2013 for a review), we predicted that
participants would maintain player-specific
representations of the probability of giving
via a prediction error update mechanism.
Further, we predicted that the current value
of this “generosity” parameter would be
recalled during opportunities for
reciprocation. We find evidence for signals of
both types in dorsomedial prefrontal cortex
(dmPFC): BOLD signal tracks prediction error
values during encoding (update), and
generosity parameters during reciprocity
(retrieval). This echoes prior research on the
role of dmPFC in trust (Behrens, et al., 2009).

Notably, these signals track lack of
generosity. Specifically, we observed
decreased activation in the region for
unpredicted generous behavior during
encoding, and decreased activation when
reciprocating to a generous partner. Thus,
our results suggest that dmPFC may be
responsible for storing and retrieving
information about other’s social behaviors,
specifically negative character traits and
then using them to guide reciprocity.

decisions in a modified trust game. The study
found greater activation of both dorsal
premotor and parietal regions in the AON for
actions made by an untrustworthy actor. In
addition, it was found this modulation was
stronger for covert unobserved actions than
for overtly observed actions. These findings
suggest an evolutionarily important role for
the AON with a focus on the simulation and
prediction of potentially threatening actions.

Science and Culture – This paper seeks to
expand our tools for understanding nonrepresentational mental processes and
behaviors. Taking a bottom-up approach
based on basic mammalian sensory-motor
systems, homeostasis, and affective
mechanisms, along with communication
abilities, a model is presented of how the
embodied storing and perception of
information in body-world loops functions as
a form of social intelligence. The affordance
theory, elements of Affective Neuroscience,
the somatic marker hypothesis, and PushmiPullyu representations provide the functional
foundations for how perception and social
interaction are forms of communicative
social intelligence. In addition to providing
an evolutionary story for the existence and
perpetuation of complex social abilities, this
model leaves room for the behavioral
complexity of cultural learning.

University – We investigated how social
comparison influenced fairness-related
decision-making and its underlying neural
mechanism by using fMRI. During the
experiment, participants played a modified
Ultimatum Game (UG) as responders. They
were not only informed of the amount of
money the proposer offered to them but also
the average amount the same proposer
offered to others, resulting in three conditions
in which participants received more, equal
and less money compared with the average
amount. As the classical UG, participants
could reject or accept the proposed offer.
Acceptance led to the suggested division
while rejection resulted in both receiving
nothing. Behavioral results demonstrated that
participants were more likely to accept
unfair offers when they received more than
others. Meanwhile, they made more
rejections when they received less than
others. At the neural level, more activation of
anterior insula was found when participants
received unequal offers compared with the
average amount; no matter they were more
than the average amount or less. These
results indicated that social comparison
played an important role during people’s
fairness-related decision-making and anterior
insula engaged in this social comparison
process.

THE NEURAL BASIS OF INTERPERSONAL
TRUST!Brian W. Haas - University of Georgia;
Megan M. Filkowski - University of Georgia –
Interpersonal trust is a fundamental socialcognitive process that strengthens social

104

!
bonds and improves the productivity within
large social groups. Although interpersonal
trust effects a large variety of human
behaviors and the way many decisions are
made, the neural substrates associated with
the tendency to trust other people remains
poorly understood. We carried out a
multimodal study designed to characterize
individual differences in the tendency to trust
other people. We used high resolution
structural MRI (VBM8-DARTEL) to examine
how individual differences in the tendency to
trust other people were associated with
localized patterns of gray matter volume. We
used a control of trust task and fMRI to
examine how individual differences in the
ability to control attitudes of interpersonal
trust were associated with localized patterns
of brain activity and functional connectivity.
Converging results indicate that interpersonal
trust is subserved by a network of brain
regions that include the ventromedial
prefrontal cortex and insula, among others.
Amygdala gray matter volume was
associated with the tendency to trust other
people as well as the tendency to distrust
other people. Greater precuneus activity
and functional connectivity was associated
with an improved ability to control attitudes
of interpersonal trust. Combined these studies
provide evidence that individual differences
in the way humans trust each other is
reflected in the structure and function of the
brain.

SOCIAL CONFORMITY, DISGUST AND
HOMOPHOBIA: AN FMRI STUDY!Marco

Tullio Liuzza - Sapienza University of Rome,
Santa Lucia Foundation; Emiliano Macaluso Santa Lucia Foundation; Patrizia A. Chiesa Sapienza University of Rome, Santa Lucia
Foundation; Salvatore M. Aglioti - Sapienza
University of Rome, Santa Lucia Foundation –
Homophobia has hypothesized to be related
with disgust, a core emotion that plays role in
the discrimination of minorities whose
behaviors and/or values are considered to
be deviant from the majority norms. In the
present fMRI study we used a social
conformity paradigm to assess whether
heterosexual (Het, N = 15) and non
exclusively heterosexual (NEH, N = 17)
individuals conformed or not to the mean
rating on the attractiveness of male bodies
provided by a putative group of gay
students. We found that NEH but not Het
conformed to the mean attractiveness rating

of the (putative) sexual minority group. In
particular, the NEH showed significantly
increased ratings after being exposed to an
upward (i.e. a higher rating) social pressure
from the minority group. Importantly,
conformist behavior was found to be related
to explicit, but not implicit, homophobia.
From the whole brain main effect of the
social pressure emerged a network that
included areas found in previous studies on
social conformity (e.g. bilateral precuneus,
right middle frontal gyrus and left inferior
frontal gyrus). Most importantly, we focused
our BOLD analysis on regions of interests
taken from a meta-analysis on discrete
emotions and found that activity in the left
anterior insula for the upward and
downward social pressure vs. agree contrast
negatively predicted conformity in Het but
not in NEH. In conclusion, the present study
suggests that brain areas involved in the
experience of disgust might indeed play a
role in stigmatizing sexual minorities.

NEURAL BASIS OF GUILT: AN FMRI ALE
META-ANALYSIS!Anthony J. Gifuni - McGill

University; Adam Kendall - McGill University;
Fabrice Jollant - McGill University –
Background. Guilt is the feeling of having
committed some wrong against oneself or
another person. It is therefore an important
component of many social behaviors. While
guilt is a part of normal human experience,
there is also a relationship between guilt and
several mental disorders, including
depression, post-traumatic stress disorder,
obsessive-compulsive disorder, psychosis,
antisocial personality disorder and suicide.
Understanding the normal and pathological
physiology of guilt is important. In recent
years, a number of neuroimaging studies
have investigated the neural correlates of
guilt. Here we quantitatively summarized the
published neuroimaging studies. Methods.
A systematic review of literature conducted
until November 2014 found 10 studies
meeting inclusion criteria, including 9 using
functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging
(fMRI) and 1 using Positron Emission
Tomography (PET) for a total of 190
participants. As few studies were conducted
in patients, we restricted our analyses to
healthy individuals to reduce heterogeneity.
A meta-analysis was then conducted using
the activation likelihood estimation program
GingerALE. An additional Meta-Analytic
Connectivity Modelling (MACM) analysis was

105

!
conducted to investigate functional
connectivity of significant clusters. Results.
The analysis revealed seven significant brain
clusters of activation encompassing the
medial frontal gyri,anterior cingulate cortex,
middle temporal gyrus, precuneus and
insula. Conclusions. Our analysis identifies the
medial frontal gyrus and the anterior
cingulate cortex as playing a central role in
guilt processing, areas that are thought to be
involved in abstract moral value processing
and theory of mind. The study of guilt in
pathological conditions should be now
conducted.!!

THE MODULATION EFFECT OF MORALITY
IN PERCEPTUAL MATCHING REVEALED BY
EVENT-RELATED BRAIN POTENTIALS!

Chuanpeng Hu - Tsinghua University; Kaiping
Peng - Tsinghua University; Jie Sui - Tsinghua
University – How the morality influence our
perception is still unclear. In the present
study, we assessed whether morality shape
our perception processing, using a novel
social learning paradigm which has shown a
stable effect of social salience of stimuli on
perception and attention. We had
participants learnt the associations between
people of different moral reputation (good,
bad, or normal) and different geometric
shapes (triangle, square, or circle). After
learning instruction, they carried out a shapemoral matching task to judge whether a pair
of sequentially presented person-shape
matched. In Experiment 1, We found that
compared to the normal person association
(as a baseline), the response to good person
association was faster and more accurate,
but no effect of the bad person association
was found. In Experiment 2, we recorded the
EEG data while 8 participants finished the
similar task as in experiment 1, to investigate
the time course of effect of morality in the
brain. The behavioral results replicated the
pattern of Experiment 1. Moreover, the ERP
results showed that the modulation effect of
moral reputation occurred as early as
approximately 100ms, with larger P1 for bad
person association and smaller P1 for good
person association. The results implied that
morality could modulate perceptual
processing in a very early stage.

ERPS REVEAL THE EARLY DETECTION OF
SPEAKER BELIEVABILITY IN VOCAL

COMMUNICATION!Xiaoming Jiang - School

of Communication Sciences and Disorders,
McGill University; Marc D. Pell - School of
Communication Sciences and Disorders,
McGill University – Dynamic formation of a
speaker’s credibility is crucial to interpersonal
communication. Using ERPs, we explored
when and how a speaker’s voice-implied ingroup or out-group status (i.e., accent
information) affects listener’s judgment of the
speaker’s believability in online vocal
communication. English statements with no
inherent truth value were produced by three
groups of speakers (native dialect; regional
dialect; foreign accent of English) in a
confident, unconfident and neutral tone.
Participants listened to each utterance and
judged how much they believed the speaker
on a scale from 1 to 5. ERPs time-locked to
utterance onset revealed a larger N100 for
the in-group than for the out-group voices.
Moreover, an early differentiation between
low and high level of believability was shown,
with the least believable utterances eliciting
a largest N1-P2 complex. Importantly, the
early N1 differentiation only occurred in outgroup voices (regional dialect and foreign
accent) but not in in-group voices, while the
P200 differentiation sustained for all voices.
The N100 difference was modulated by
whether participants held a positive social
attitude towards the out-group speaker
(perceived competence, intelligence, etc.).
Although statements with higher mean f0,
larger f0 variance and certain voice qualities
generally sound less believable, this effect
seems larger for the in-group than for the
out-group voices. A lack of believability can
be rapidly and reliably detected 200 ms after
vocal information is encountered; moreover,
the effect of a listener’s stereotype towards
an out-group member can be mediated by
N100 response, which subserves an initial
acoustic analysis preceding vocal
judgments.

NEURAL SIGNALS UNDERLYING SELFEVALUATION BIAS DURING DISHONEST
DECISIONS!Eunbin S. Kim - Rutgers University;

Megan E. Speer - Rutgers University; Mauricio
R. Delgado - Rutgers University – Does the
extent of individuals’ own transgressions
affect their judgments of the self-v.-others?
Previous studies examining moral judgments
and behaviors have found that biases exist in
how people judge their own immoral

106

!
behaviors primarily through hypothetical
scenarios (e.g., Manley et al., 2001). The
present study investigated the neural
correlates of active engagement in moral
decisions and its relationship with self-v.-other
evaluations. Participants played a game
where they could win monetary rewards by
correctly predicting whether a card’s value
was higher or lower than the number 5.
Incorrect predictions, however, resulted in a
monetary charity donation. Periodically
throughout the task, participants had
opportunities to cheat on incorrect trials to
gain additional self-rewards (i.e., money
intended for charity). Following the
prediction task, participants made self-andother evaluations on their moral behavior. In
both a behavioral (N = 27) and preliminary
fMRI sample (N = 9), we observed that
individuals underestimated the extent of their
own dishonest behavior. That is, participants
believed to have cheated less frequently
compared to their actual behavior, which
was presented as the average cheating
behavior of all participants. Interestingly, a
preliminary fMRI analysis contrasting the
period of opportunity v. no-opportunity to
cheat showed greater activity in regions
previously implicated in executive control
(e.g., anterior cingulate), which may reflect
conflict during the decision-making process.
Consistent with this finding, participants
deliberated longer on trials when given an
opportunity to behave dishonestly. Future
analyses will examine how neural activity
during moral deliberation relates to the
extent of biases in self-judgment.

HOW MORAL CHARACTER SHAPES
MORAL JUDGEMENT!Jenifer Z. Siegel -

University of Oxford; Molly J. Crockett University of Oxford; Ray Dolan - University
College London – Inferring the moral
character of others is crucial for successful
social interactions. Previous work suggests
that we infer someone’s character by
judging the morality of their actions: moral
judgments shape character assessments.
Here, we examine the distinct but related
question of whether character assessments,
in turn, shape moral judgments. Subjects
observed and judged sequences of
decisions made by agents who were either
selfish or kind. Each decision involved a
tradeoff between personal profit and pain
for a third-party victim. Across trials we
manipulated the magnitude of profit and

pain resulting from the agent’s decision, and
whether the agent made an active or a
passive response. We built and compared
computational models to describe subjects’
moral judgments and find that, in line with
previous findings, moral judgments are
sensitive to consequences, distinctions
between actions and omissions, and to the
presence of personal incentives.
Furthermore, we show that the underlying
character of the agent being judged – i.e.,
whether the agent is selfish or kind – exerts an
independent effect on moral judgments and
also moderates the influence of actions and
incentives on judgments. We suggest these
findings may result from interactions between
Pavlovian and instrumental systems for
reinforcement learning and decision-making.

NEURAL CORRELATES OF SELFCONSCIOUS EMOTIONS!Michael Gilead -

Columbia University; Maayan Katzir - BenGurion University of the Negev; Tal Eyal - BenGurion University of the Negev; Nira Libmeran
- Tel-Aviv University – Self-conscious emotions
are prevalent in our daily lives and play an
important role in both normal and
pathological behavior. Despite the immense
significance of self-conscious emotions,
relatively little is known regarding their neural
basis. In light of this, we conducted an fMRI
study in which participants thought of various
personal events which elicited feelings of
negative and positive self-conscious (i.e.,
guilt, pride) or basic (i.e., anger, joy)
emotions. We performed a conjunction
analysis to investigate the neural correlates
associated with processing self-conscious vs.
basic emotions, irrespective of valence. The
results show that processing self-conscious
emotions resulted in activation within frontal
areas associated with abstract thought and
self-control, namely, the mPFC extending to
the ACC, and within the lateral-dorsal
prefrontal cortex. Processing basic emotions
resulted in activation throughout relatively
phylogentically-ancient regions of the cortex,
namely in visual and tactile processing areas
and the insular cortex. Furthermore, selfconscious emotions differentially activated
the mPFC such that the negative selfconscious emotion (guilt) was associated
with a more dorsal activation, and the
positive self-conscious emotion (pride) was
associated with a more ventral activation.
We discuss how these results shed light on the
nature of mental representations and neural

107

systems involved in self-reflective and
affective processing.

STRESS EXPOSURE DECREASES
COOPERATIVE DECISION-MAKING
BEHAVIOR Candace Raio - New York

University; Oriel FeldmanHall - New York
University; Mrunalini Gaikwad - New York
University; Frederico DePauli - Cornell
University; Jeni Kubota - University of
Chicago; Elizabeth Phelps - New York
University – Previous research has shown that
cooperation is a common phenomenon
across species, despite being immediately
disadvantageous to personal gain. This form
of prosocial behavior has been widely
examined in the context of economic
decision-making, but it is unknown how
aversive emotional states encountered in
everyday life, such as those induced by
stress, influence such behavior. Since stress
has been shown to engender reliance on
habitual forms of behavior it is possible that
stress may enhance cooperation, which has
been described as an automatic or intuitive
response. Alternately, the aversive nature of
stress exposure may enhance individuals’
propensity to behave selfishly in order to
secure additional resources. Here, we sought
to distinguish these possibilities by combining
a well-characterized, classic behavioral
economic game that measures cooperative
decision-making behavior with an acute
stress manipulation known to reliably engage
sympathetic and neuroendocrine responses
to stress. Participants underwent a stress
induction task (i.e., cold pressor task) or
control task before playing either the
Prisoner’s Dilemma game, in which
participants could either cooperate with a
partner for a lower monetary reward, or
betray them for higher monetary gain, or a
matched non-social lottery game. Our data
reveal that stress exposure reduced prosocial
behavior by decreasing cooperation and
increasing individuals’ propensity to betray
their partners for more money. By studying
the effect of an ecologically valid stress
induction on cooperative decision-making,
this work promises to situate our
understanding of prosociality in a broader
framework that reflects the influence of realworld conditions of stress exposure.

THE ROLE OF THEORY OF MIND REGIONS
IN COOPERATIVE VERSUS COMPETITIVE
INTERACTIONS!Lily Tsoi - Boston College;

James Dungan - Boston College; Adam
Waytz - Northwestern University; Liane Young
- Boston College – Our capacity to consider
people’s mental states (i.e., theory of mind;
ToM) is crucial for social interaction with close
others in the case of affiliation or
cooperation and enemies in strategic
interactions or competition. In an fMRI study
involving a game variant of “Rock, Paper,
Scissors”, we investigated whether
cooperative versus competitive interactions
differentially recruit brain regions for ToM,
such as the right and left temporoparietal
junction (TPJ), precuneus, and dorsomedial
prefrontal cortex (dmPFC). In this game
variant, players (the participant and a
confederate posing as another player)
chose between two shapes (circle or square)
in each trial. In cooperate trials, both players
shared the same goal (e.g., to guess the
same shape); in compete trials, players had
opposing goals (e.g., one player was told to
guess the same shape while the other was
told to guess the opposite shape). Univariate
region of interest (ROI) analyses reveal that
ToM regions are similarly recruited for
cooperate and compete trials. However,
ROI-based multivariate pattern analyses
(MVPA) reveal different spatial patterns of
neural activity in these ToM regions for
cooperate and compete trials. These MVPA
results did not extend to cooperate and
compete trials in a control condition in which
players were unable to choose their shape
(players were told that the computer made
the choices). These results suggest that while
ToM regions are similarly recruited for
cooperative and competitive interactions,
these regions encode the representational
content underlying cooperative and
competitive interactions that specifically
involve choices and decisions made by
people.

THE SOCIAL VALUE OF SHARING
EXPERIENCES!Eshin Jolly

- Dartmouth College; Diana I. Tamir Stanford University; Jason P. Mitchell Harvard University – Social experiences can
be rich sources of happiness, and previous
work has demonstrated that reminiscing
about or anticipating these experiences is

108

!
highly rewarding. However, research has yet
to fully explain the immediate social value
associated with sharing experiences with
others. In this study we used a novel
experience-sharing and decision-making
paradigm and functional MRI to understand
this social value. In five behavioral studies,
participants chose between watching a
video by themselves or with a study partner.
Each option was paired with a variable
monetary reward. Consistent with the
hypothesis that individuals value social
experiences, participants consistently gave
up money to watch a video with another
person. Remarkably, they did so despite
consistent evidence that they did not find
experiences any more enjoyable when
shared. In a subsequent fMRI experiment,
individuals passively viewed a video with
(share) or without (solo) a study partner. Trials
were separable across an anticipation phase
and an experience phase. Analyses were
performed on the contrast of shared > solo in
brain regions associated with motivation,
reward and mentalizing. Ventral striatum was
observed across both phases, suggesting
increased subjective value for the shared
experience. Dorsomedial prefrontal cortex
emerged during the experience phase
suggesting participants were actively
considering their study partner’s thoughts
and feelings during the video. Activity during
the anticipation phase in these regions
positively correlated with how close
individuals felt to their study partners. These
results suggest that participants value sharing
experiences with others, but that doing so
does not increase enjoyment of the
experiences themselves.

THE INFLUENCE OF GENDERED
CHARACTERISTICS ON INTERPERSONAL
SYNCHRONY!Rachel G. Pizzie - Dartmouth

College; Eric Hehman - New York University;
Jonathan B. Freeman - New York University –
In even brief interactions, we perceive a
multitude of information about other
individuals. Prior research has examined how
gender influences dyadic interactions, but it
is less understood how these interactions may
be shaped by interaction partners’ gender
stereotypes, as well as their own adherence
to those stereotypes. The current work
examined how the interplay of gender and
stereotypes would influence behavioral
synchrony. Increased behavioral synchrony is
typically associated with affiliation and liking,

and often operates outside of conscious
control. Participants were video-recorded
while participating in a brief conversation in
same-sex dyads (N = 96, 20 female dyads, 18
male dyads). Individual differences in gender
stereotypes (Ambivalent Sexism Inventory;
ASI) and self-reported behavioral adherence
to those stereotypes (Bem Sex Role Inventory;
BSRI) were assessed following the interaction.
Frame differencing measures were used to
sensitively measure behavioral synchrony
during the interaction. We found that
synchrony was associated with ASI and BSRI
scores, but these relationships were
moderated by gender. Specifically, greater
ASI scores were associated with increased
behavioral synchrony for male-male dyads
(specifically the benevolent sexism
subcomponent), whereas this was not true
for female-female dyads. Conversely, for
female-female dyads, greater scores on the
BSRI (feminine subscale) were associated
with an increased level of synchrony,
whereas for male-male dyads they were
associated with decreased synchrony. Taken
together, individual differences in gender
stereotypes and adherence to those
stereotypes differentially predicted
behavioral synchrony in brief interactions.
These findings suggest that dissociable
stereotype-related processes function
differently for men and women to drive
synchrony in real-world interactions.

INTER-SUBJECT PHASE SYNCHRONIZATION
OF HEART RATE VARIABILITY DURING
COOPERATIVE VIDEO GAME PLAYING!
Sotaro Shimada - Meiji University; Tomomasa
Sakano - Meiji University; Yumie Ono - Meiji
University – Cooperative multi-player video
games provide a promising research
platform to investigate human social
behavior and its neural underpinnings. In this
study, we measured heart rate variability
(HRV) of two players cooperating in a simple
puzzle game (Tetris) and examined whether
the HRV signals showed inter-subject
synchronization during the play. Sixteen male
subject pairs (aged 21.8±0.4 years) were
participated in the experiment. The subject
pair performed independent (but
simultaneous) single-player gameplays and
cooperative two-player gameplays
alternately, repeating 6 times. In the twoplayer mode, two Tetris blocks in a single
game screen were separately operated by
the two players to erase the blocks in a

109

!
cooperative fashion. The length of each
gameplay was 1 min with inter-trial interval of
1 min. In order to examine how the
autonomic nerves of two players were
intertwined, we calculated phase synchrony
index (PSI) of HRV time-frequency data. We
found that PSI was significantly higher in the
cooperative gameplay than in the singlemode gameplay both in the low-frequency
(LF: 0.04-0.15 Hz; P<0.001) and the highfrequency (HF: 0.15-0.4 Hz; p<0.005) HRV
bands. Most interestingly, when the data was
time-locked to the event that the two falling
Tetris blocks accidentally collided with each
other, PSI in LF decreased significantly in the
successive period of 3-11 s after the collision
(P<0.05, t-test). These results suggest that
inter-subject HRV coupling during
cooperative gameplay, which could be
interrupted by the erroneous play, can be
used as a physiological measure to evaluate
the ongoing inter-subject interaction.

TELL ME ANOTHER ONE: AN FNIRS STUDY
OF NEURAL COUPLING IN NATURAL
STORYTELLING!Kristin Shumaker - University of
Pennsylvania; Matthew B. O'Donnell University of Pennsylvania; Nicholette Gregor
- University of Michigan; Lynda Lin - University
of Pennsylvania; Emily B. Falk - University of
Pennsylvania – Successful communication
depends upon the ability of speakers and
listeners to align during the processing of
common messages (e.g. persuasive
messages or everyday stories). Previous fMRI
studies of narrative transmission suggest that
neural coupling between speakers and
listeners underlies successful social
interactions (Hasson et al., 2012; Stephens,
Silbert, & Hasson, 2010). Other fMRI studies
have highlighted the role of the mentalizing
system, particularly the TPJ, in predicting
which speakers are more likely to effectively
transmit ideas to their listeners (Falk, Morelli,
Welborn, Dambacher, & Lieberman, 2013).
However, the fMRI environment limits the
ability to capture neural activity in dynamic
social interactions. With the ability to record
continuous neural activity with time-locked
video viewing and recording during
naturalistic conversation, functional nearinfrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) affords the
potential to increase the ecological validity
of communication tasks. Here, we examine
speaker-listener coupling in the mentalizing
system (TPJ and DMPFC) while subjects
engage in narrative transmission. Participants

(target n=60; data collection in progress)
record videos telling stories (5-7 minutes) of
memorable, real-life occurrences while
undergoing fNIRS. They also listen to a story
told by another participant, adopt that story
and retell it in the first person. Previously, we
have found that mentalizing in speakers
during persuasive message propagation
predicts the mentalizing activity in listeners
during listening to a message (Shumaker,
O’Donnell, Gregor, Lin & Falk, in prep). Using
intersubject correlation, we will examine
neural coupling between TPJ, DMPFC and
MPFC, occurring during the telling and
retelling of authentic and adopted personal
narratives.

Delaware; Adam B. Magerman - University of
Delaware; Chad E. Forbes - University of
Delaware – This study examined the neural
biomarkers that immediately precede
decisions to trust (or distrust) novel others. To
examine trust related processes, White
participants completed a coin flip game with
either a White or Black confederate who
reported the outcome of a simulated coin
flip. Participants were told that at various
points throughout the game the reporter
would be motivated to lie. For each flip,
participants decided whether or not to trust
the confederate’s response while continuous
EEG activity was recorded. Using a data
driven approach, we probed for neural
biomarkers elicited during time intervals
immediately before players decided to trust
reporters. Source localization models
conducted on 750 ms and 250 ms predecision yielded sources in the insula, inferior
frontal gyrus, medial frontal gyrus, and the
anterior cingulate cortex. Time frequency
analyses conducted in these sources
revealed increased communication (defined
as increased phase-locking in the theta and
alpha frequency bands) between the insula,
inferior frontal gyrus and medial frontal gyrus
for distrusting trials compared to trusting trials.
These neural patterns were evident
regardless of the confederate’s race.
Findings provide evidence that increased
communication between a general neural
network of regions involved in affective

110

processing and self-regulation in ambiguous
situations bias individuals towards decisions
to distrust novel others.

PUPILLARY SYNCHRONY EMERGES
ACROSS DYADS AS A FUNCTION OF
SHARED ATTENTION!Olivia Kang -

Dartmouth College; Thalia Wheatley Dartmouth College – Everyone wants to be
understood, to connect at a deep level with
other people. Forging these connections
requires joint attention: we must be able to
understand and share others’ thoughts and
feelings. As demonstrated by Zaki and
colleagues (2008), this ability is dependent
on others making their perspectives easy to
infer (expressivity), as well as our own
empathy. On the basis of these findings and
research demonstrating that the pupillary
response sensitively indexes dynamic
attention (Wierda et al., 2012), we
hypothesized that shared attention would
yield shared patterns of pupil dilation (i.e.,
synchrony) across individuals. Moreover, we
predicted that the degree of pupillary
synchrony between a speaker-listener dyad
would vary as a function of expressivity and
empathy. We video-taped and eye-tracked
“Speakers” as they relayed positive and
negative emotional memories, and then
eye-tracked an independent group of
“Listeners” as they passively watched these
videos (adapting Zaki et al's empathic
accuracy paradigm, 2008). Speakers were
either high- or low-expressive (scoring in the
outer quartiles of the Berkeley Expressivity
Questionnaire; Gross, 2000) and listeners’
cognitive empathy was measured using the
perspective-taking scale of the Interpersonal
Reactivity Index (Davis, 1983). Pupillary
synchrony emerged as a function of the
interaction between speakers’ expressivity
and listeners’ cognitive empathy, such that
greatest synchrony was found in highexpressive, high-empathic pairs. These
findings suggest that shared attention is
interpersonal (dependent on listener's
empathy and speakers' expressivity) and
manifested by pupillary synchrony across a
dyad.

THE GEOMETRY OF AFFECTIVE SPACE: A
REVISED FRAMEWORK FOR REPRESENTING
THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN AROUSAL
AND VALENCE Alison M. Mattek -

Dartmouth College; George L. Wolford Dartmouth College; Paul J. Whalen Dartmouth College – The literature contains
notable disagreements concerning the
relationship between the dimensions of
arousal and valence. Some theories
emphasize the fact that arousal and valence
are independent, while positive and
negative evaluations are dependent (i.e.,
anti-correlated; Russell 1980). Others depict
arousal and valence as dependent (i.e.,
correlated), while positive and negative
evaluations are independent (Cacioppo &
Berntson, 1994; Lang 1995). Here, we offer a
revised geometric framework that identifies
the conditions under which these affective
dimensions co-vary or vary independently,
using data from 133 subjects across 4
datasets, providing ratings of emotional
faces, vocalizations, music, visual scenes,
sentences, and words. First, the data define
an empirical boundary reflecting the
dependence of valence and arousal ratings,
which takes mathematical form as a
nonlinear inequality (a ≥ |v|)*. However,
they also show that independent positive
and negative dimensions do not sufficiently
account for the arousal dimension. These
seemingly opposing findings are reconciled
with a triangular affective space anchored
by three mutually exclusive categories (i.e.,
positive, negative, and neutral). In this
space, arousal and valence are dependent
upon each other on the edges of the space
where clearly valenced positive/negative
stimuli reside, but these dimensions vary
independently in the central aspects of the
space inhabited by ambiguously valenced
stimuli. Conversely, positive and negative
evaluations are dependent upon each other
in the central ambiguously valenced aspects
of the space, but vary independently along
the clearly valenced edges of the space.
These findings reveal that the relationship
between affective dimensions depends on
the presence of ambiguity.

I FEEL THE SAME WAY: NEURAL
MECHANISMS UNDERLYING SOCIAL
INFLUENCES ON EMOTION Rebecca E.

Martin - Columbia University; Kevin N.
Ochsner - Columbia University –!Emotions,
though generated individually, are strongly
influenced by other people. The goal of this
study was to examine how other people

!
shape our emotions. We scanned
participants (N=24) while they viewed and
rated pictures of positive, negative, and
neutral scenes on a 1 to 7 scale indicating
how bad or good the scene made them
feel. Following their rating participants were
shown what they believed to be a group
rating from a sample of approximately 100
peers. After a rest period, participants then
rerated the scenes a second time, this time
without seeing peer ratings. We found a
strong main effect of peer ratings such that
participants changed their second ratings of
the scenes to conform to those of their peers.
This effect was strongest for negatively
valenced scenes. At the neural level, our
findings replicated previous studies (e.g.,

Klucharev et al., 2009; Izuma & Adolphs,
2013) demonstrating activation of the rostral
cingulate during peer conflict (when peers
rated items higher or lower than
participants), and this activation was
modulated by the magnitude of conflict.
We also found activity in lateral prefrontal
regions while viewing peer ratings.
Additionally, we found that amygdala
activation for negative scenes was either
enhanced or dampened depending on
whether peers rated scenes as more or less
negative. Future directions include using
connectivity and mediation analyses to
explore the functional relationship between
networks associated with social influence
and emotional reactivity.
